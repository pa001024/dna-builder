In a harsh world where people often disguise their true intentions with deceit and pleasantries, Berenica's candid remarks cut through these facades, always resulting in uncomfortable silences. As a child, her blunt honesty was often dismissed as mere youthful innocence. However, as she grew older, this trait increasingly alienated her from others in the village.\nConsequently, from a young age, you mastered the art of reading people and skillfully adapting your words to deal with different individuals. For the things she disliked or struggled with, you stepped in. You decided that you would be her mask and her voice.",

Purgatorio Island, adrift in the desolate sea, is far from a paradise. On this beautiful little island, the malice that festers in hardship and isolation is all too familiar. The strong prey on the weak, and the weak, in turn, target those even weaker — it's a natural law that the villagers of Purgatorio Island know well and follow to the letter.\nHowever, this brutal \"law of survival\" met an unexpected challenge in the form of a little girl named Berenica.\nDespite being an orphan with no one to rely on, the hardships of life had not instilled in Berenica any idea of compromise or inclination to yield. Once she set her mind on something, neither brute intimidation nor sweet coaxing could make her budge. Even the island's brawniest fishermen couldn't overpower her — partly because her strength was shockingly immense for a child, but more so because she would fight with a ferocity that belied her size, like the cub of a savage beast baring its baby fangs. Nevertheless, there weren't many things that would push her buttons — she wasn't greedy for food or fortune. The only things she would desperately fight for were those concerning another child named {nickname}.\nBut that was a long time ago. By the time Berenica had grown to half the height of a grown man, not even all the adults on Purgatorio Island combined could stand against her. The way they looked at her had changed — their stares now held a hint of fear. \"She's probably a monster,\" they thought.\nBut aren't monsters supposed to be inherently selfish? Would a monster cherish another soul as deeply as she does?",

        text: 'It was a midsummer morning, an otherwise unremarkable day on Purgatorio Island. The fishermen rose early, collecting freshly mended nets and sails from their wives before heading to the small pier where their boats awaited. They were set to face the briny breeze at sea for days, hoping to return laden with fish to sustain their families in the coming weeks.\nAmid the hustle of farewells at the dock, no one noticed a young girl, Abigail, sneaking away in the opposite direction, up the muddy mountain path. As she ran, the clamour of the village receded, and the wind whistling through charred branches filled the air with mournful sounds. Abigail reassured herself it wasn\'t the Filthoids, pressing a hand to her chest to steady her racing heart before keeping on.\nFor the villagers, the mountains were not a place to visit these days. Just two days ago, they had heard a deafening roar from the abandoned temple in the mountains, followed by a fire that was fortunately doused by a sudden downpour. Some claimed it was the goddess punishing them for their irreverence; others whispered it was the work of the woman who lived in the mountains, or that the Filthoids had been roused. Despite the varied theories, everyone agreed on one thing: stay away from the mountain, at least for now.\nBut Abigail had no choice. Her mother\'s gout had worsened, and Abigail had heard her mother\'s pained groans echoing through the night. She knew of a medicinal herb near the temple that might offer relief. Despite the risks, she resolved to make the journey.\nPreoccupied with her destination, she failed to notice what lay hidden in the undergrowth and was brought down by something soft underfoot. Rubbing her bruised knee, she glanced at the thicket, and the sight made her gasp and stumble back in terror.\n"A d—dead body...!!!"\nIt was a child, about five or six years old, with delicate features that suggested she was a girl. The little girl was covered in soot and grime, her once beautiful silver hair matted with mud. Curled up tightly like a newborn, she lay surrounded by the lifeless bodies of several Filthoids, along with a blackened knife.\nHad she been attacked by the Filthoids? But if so, who killed those beasts?\n"You..." Overcoming her initial shock, Abigail\'s concern took over. She clutched her pounding chest and hesitantly prodded the little girl\'s shoulder. "Hey, are you... alive?"\nWhether it was because Abigail had just accidentally stepped on her or because Abigail\'s voice woke her, the "corpse" suddenly shuddered, followed by intense trembling. She\'s alive! Relief washed over Abigail. "Thank goodness! Lemme help you get up!"\nTrying to grasp the little girl\'s hand, Abigail found her arms tightly crossed over something clutched to her chest. No matter how hard Abigail tugged, the girl wouldn\'t let go. "You have to give me your hand," Abigail sighed, circling around to face the child. "It\'s okay, I\'m here to help you."\nThe little girl struggled to open her eyes, warily watching Abigail, her gaze meeting Abigail\'s sincere, kind eyes. She bit her chapped lips, as if wrestling with a tough decision. Finally, with a heavy nod, she seemed to make up her mind, reluctantly loosening her arms.\nAs dawn\'s light filtered through the trees, Abigail finally saw what the girl had been guarding so desperately — it was another, even younger, child.',

        text: 'On the first evening, the two children lay huddled in the grass, their faint, laboured breaths were the only sign of life. Abigail had seen similar scenes during childhood hunting trips with her father, where she encountered orphaned young animals helplessly huddled in thickets without their mothers.\nAbigail placed a jug of fresh water beside the older girl, alongside some dried fish and stale bread arranged on a scrap of cloth — it was the best she could do. When she had pleaded with the villagers to help save the children, she was met with stark indifference. While the kinder villagers explained that the community was too poor to take on the burden of two more mouths to feed, those less kind chastised her for even venturing up the mountain. Some recognised the horns on the children\'s heads — a feature unwelcome back in their homeland of Hyperborea. Even her usually compassionate mother frowned, saying their own family was barely getting by and couldn\'t afford additional burdens.\n"I hope you\'ll both be safe," Abigail murmured, setting down the food and casting one last worried glance back before walking away.\n\nBy the second night, the older girl had regained some strength. She managed to get up, lifting the younger child and staggering towards a small cave nearby for shelter from the nighttime rain. Although devoid of food, the cave offered them a dry place to rest. After settling the younger child inside, she collapsed to the ground, utterly drained. Following a brief rest, she stumbled back to where Abigail had left the provisions. She opened the jug and drank deeply before realising something; she then quickly capped it and stumbled back towards the cave — knowing how precious this jug of fresh water was, she saved most of it for the younger child.\n\nOn the third morning, when Abigail once again sneaked up the mountain, she found the girl sitting by the cave wall, bandaging her wounds with that scrap of cloth she had left behind. Despite being covered in injuries, the girl appeared somewhat revitalized, a faint sparkle returning to her crimson eyes. Abigail noticed the girl\'s lips moving, as if she wanted to say something, but instead, she remained silent, staring intently at the empty jug.\nRealising the girl must be thirsty, Abigail picked up the jug, intending to refill it at the stream. Suddenly, the girl grabbed her arm, shaking her head firmly. "I... go with you," she rasped, her voice raw from disuse.\nAbigail helped the girl to the stream, watching as she struggled to lean down and fill the jug. The girl seemed reluctant to rely on anyone\'s help, trying to do everything herself despite her injuries. Abigail felt a twinge of sympathy. Although the village children were taught to share their parents\' burdens from a young age, it pained her to see a child so young bearing such severe wounds and striving to do everything alone.\n\nOn the fourth afternoon, a group of fishermen returned home. They had a bountiful catch this time, which sold for a good price at the empire\'s port, allowing them to bring back cloth and food from the mainland. This was usually the happiest day for the village children, but Abigail\'s mind was still on the girls in the mountains. She carefully wrapped her share of the pastries and tucked it into her basket.\nReaching the mountain, Abigail saw that the girl had cleaned her face in the stream. With the grime gone, Abigail realised that she was quite a beautiful child.\n"Th-Thank... you," the girl\'s voice was less hoarse than the day before. It seemed she hadn\'t spoken in a long time, carefully enunciating each syllable. "Thank you." She solemnly took the basket from Abigail. "With this... {性别：he|she} will get better soon."\nCurious, Abigail couldn\'t help but ask, "Where do you two come from? I\'ve never seen you before. Oh, and..." She hesitated, curiosity getting the better of her, "I\'ve heard there was a woman living on the mountain. Is she your mother? What happened to her? Do you know anything about the loud noise a few days ago?"\nAt the mention of the woman on the mountain, the girl\'s body visibly tensed. "Can\'t... can\'t talk about it," she muttered, biting her lower lip.\n"Alright, forget it." Abigail waved it off, feeling a bit deflated. "The village\'s more crowded these days, I might not be able to sneak up here very often. You two take care of yourselves, alright?"\n\nOn the evening of the tenth day, Abigail encountered the two children by the sea.\nThey appeared to have fully recovered. The two small figures stood on the beach where the tide had receded, the setting sun casting a golden glow on their beautiful silver hair and the vast expanse of white sand.\nUpon seeing Abigail, the older child took the younger one\'s hand and slowly walked over, carrying the basket Abigail had left behind, now filled with small fish, shrimp, and crabs. "This is for you," she said. "As a thank-you."\nAbigail was about to decline the offer with a wave of her hand, but the determination in the girl\'s eyes made her reconsider. Accepting the basket, she noticed the girl\'s faint smile.\nAbigail smiled back, feeling reassured that they were now capable of surviving on their own.\n\nYears later, during an interview with The Tides Daily, Abigail Morley, now a successful fishing tycoon, reflected on some deep memories upon the reporter\'s question: "Ms Morley, I have one last question. I\'ve heard you built your fortune from scratch. What changed your life? Or rather, what are the three most significant events that shaped it?"\n"The first event was when my home island was ravaged by Filthoids. My parents and I managed to escape, but they were already in poor health and sustained injuries along the way. They passed away soon after, leaving me to fend for myself. As for the second event... it might have had more significance to the world than to me."\nAbigail paused, her thoughts drifting back to that seemingly ordinary morning many years ago. While the villagers were busy seeing off the fishermen, young Abigail ventured alone into the mountains to gather herbs for her ailing mother.\n"That day, I saved two children younger than myself on the mountain," she continued. "At the time, I didn\'t realise I was setting the wheels of history in motion."',

To avoid startling these creatures, especially in emergencies, Berenica came up with a system of silent signals: two taps on the right shoulder meant "watch your back," and two taps over the heart signified "come closer."\n"Let\'s add one more — a nose boop to signal \'all clear.\'" Berenica suggested to {nickname}.

Their menacing red lights flickered as they surged towards the young girl at the centre.\nClutching her sword, the girl struggled to rise from the remnants of her previous foes. Despite the searing pain that racked her body and the near exhaustion of her arms, she swiftly adjusted her stance. Hoisting the red blade taller than herself, she mechanically repeated her slashing motions. The adults in dark grey uniforms had taught her that failure to do so meant she would be the one shattered on the floor.\nToday\'s opponents were tougher, and the training session lasted longer than ever before. Such a gruelling test was far beyond what any child should endure, yet the girl had no concept of normalcy. She was unaware that beyond the one-way glass, those adults were observing her with feverish excitement, while the only feedback she ever received was a repetitive "not enough." Since birth, she had been indoctrinated with a single purpose: to become the sharpest of swords. Thus, she unquestioningly accepted each brutal training session, enduring the pain and viewing each harsher challenge as an affirmation of her worth.\n"That\'s enough for today. Good job, No. 0."\nThe day\'s training ended with a light, almost dismissive praise. Drained, the girl dragged herself back to her room, too weary even to eat. She collapsed into bed, but was tormented by her wounds to the point of sleeplessness. She lay counting the minutes, hoping for the pain to subside more quickly.\n"Child... child?"\nA voice whispered at midnight as the girl continued counting the minutes. It was so gentle, like the moonlight slipping into her room through the narrow window. "I must be dreaming," she thought, for in this steel prison, no one ever spoke to her like this. But the voice came again, closer this time, as if right beside her bed. In the darkness, she couldn\'t see the speaker. She sat up in her cold bed, whispering, "Are you...talking to me?"\nHer voice trembled. The visitor seemed nervous too. "Yes. Don\'t be afraid, child... here, have some fruit!"\nThat figure offered softly, handing over a small, deep-red fruit in their palm. Much later, Berenica would learn its name — pomegranate.\n"My name is \'No. 0,\'" the girl murmured, nervously fiddling with the fruit in her hands.\n"That\'s not a good name." the figure replied, reaching out a hand towards her.

She realised this person was tempting her to do something against the rules, something that defied her destiny, something she should reject outright and report to the adults in dark grey uniforms. Yet the moonlight, now piercing through the window, illuminated the visitor\'s sincere, pure eyes, igniting in the girl a profound yearning to escape to a place where she might touch the moon herself.\nNodding, she grasped the extended hand and whispered, "Okay."',

"Quickly, take {nickname} down to the village at the foot of the mountain." She paused, rifling through a drawer to retrieve several pieces of fine jewellery and a pocket watch. "Take these with you. The villagers might take you in. Just tell them you\'re orphans who drifted ashore and know nothing about the outside world, and that these were your mother\'s belongings."\n"Aren\'t you coming with us?" Berenica asked.\n"I can\'t."\nBerenica froze, her mind going blank. She blinked in disbelief. "You\'re... leaving us?"\n"You\'ll never have a peaceful life with me around. Just go, protect {nickname}, and live your own lives. Forget about the Hyperborean Empire, the 13th Legion, and No. 0. Remember, you\'re just an ordinary child. You\'re Berenica. Just Berenica."\nShe reeled off her instructions rapidly, then tenderly stroked Berenica\'s hair once more. There was a fleeting hesitation, a reluctance to part, that Berenica felt deeply in her touch. But the woman quickly withdrew her hand as if it burned, turned away, and steeled her voice. "No time to lose. Remember your sprint training? You have ten minutes. Leave the temple and reach the village road in ten minutes. This is an order."\nThe woman\'s authoritative tone revived Berenica\'s earliest memories — follow every order without question. That had been drilled into her since she could remember. She instinctively responded, "Yes, ma\'am." But then she paused, shaking her head and looking desperately at the woman as if begging her to rescind the order. "Why...? I don\'t understand—"\n"Berenica, forget about me and everything in the past. Never come back here."\nBerenica instinctively stepped back as the temple door thundered shut before her. She didn\'t even see when the woman pressed the button to trigger the mechanism. {nickname}, startled by the sudden noise, clung to her arm in fear.\nWith one last lingering look at the closed door, Berenica scooped up {nickname} and set off without turning back.\n"I have ten minutes," she echoed the command, "protect {nickname}, and live on..." She muttered under her breath, "I can do this."\nTen minutes later, as Berenica walked the mountain path, a deafening explosion rolled up from behind. She didn\'t know exactly what had transpired, but she had a pretty good idea. She blinked, but her eyes remained dry — tears had long been strangers to her. Yet, something within her seemed to spill over, like the debris tumbling down the mountain behind her.\nThat night saw both mountain fire and deluge, and to Berenica, the rain from that night never ceased.\nAfterwards, Berenica and {nickname} narrowly escaped death by the Filthoids and were rescued by a kind-hearted girl from the village. Despite everything, they managed to survive.\nLater on, Berenica returned to the temple\'s entrance several times, though she never dared to break her promise by turning the "key." Instead, she stood silently outside, waiting. She hoped that one day the door would suddenly open, and the woman would step out, tenderly smiling, and bend down to pat her head and say, "Everything\'s okay now. I\'m back."\nSeasons changed, but the door remained shut, and waiting became a habit. It was not until a dried pomegranate fell and struck Berenica on the head one day that she abruptly snapped back to reality. She picked up the pomegranate and remembered how, every year when the fruit ripened, that woman would pick some to bring home, wash them clean, and give them to her and {nickname} to eat.\nClutching the shrivelled, already inedible fruit, Berenica finally realised the woman would never return. From then on, it would be just her and {nickname}.\n"I will keep my promise," she vowed silently. "I will take good care of {性别：him|her}, and I won\'t let you down."',

        text: 'Perhaps it was a stroke of luck that Berenica\'s rigorous childhood training made adapting to a nomadic life almost effortless. In the early days after escaping the Legion, she followed the woman who had rescued her, enduring nights in damp, dark caves, braving tempests on churning seas, and evading Imperial pursuers along precipitous cliffs. No matter how harsh or dangerous the circumstances, she never once complained or paused for rest.\nYet, more difficult than enduring pain was the challenge of forgetting it.\nEven after escaping that prison and successfully evading endless pursuit, the shadows of her past lingered. Even after settling down on Purgatorio Island, remnants of her old life persistently haunted her: she would wake up before dawn, sitting blankly for long moments before realising there was no longer a need for early morning training. Despite food being within easy reach, she would wait until the designated mealtime to eat. When sick or injured, she bore the discomfort silently, never seeking help. If she accidentally came into physical contact with anyone, she instinctively recoiled, sometimes even taking a battle stance. Occasionally, even a bird flying past the window could jolt her into alertness.\nThen she met you — small, soft, exuding innocence from within the embrace of that woman, your smile untainted by the world. Tentatively, she touched your cheek, and you clutched her finger with your tiny hand. You seemed so delicate, as if the slightest danger could easily snuff out your life.\nFor the first time, Berenica felt a deep urge to protect someone. To set a good example for you, she disciplined herself to adopt regular sleeping and waking routines. To ensure your healthy growth, she experimented with various foods, clumsily collecting all sorts of ingredients that people said were delicious. To care for your health, she learned to recognise the signs of illness — like how catching a cold would bring coughs, and heatstroke would cause dizziness. To avoid frightening you, she trained herself to suppress her instinctual defensive reactions and began to smile more often. As she watched you grow, she gradually rediscovered herself, reclaiming the human experiences and feelings she thought she had long lost.\nOne ordinary afternoon, after cleaning the house, Berenica leaned back in her chair and inadvertently dozed off. In her half-sleep, she felt a familiar touch on her face. When she opened her eyes, there you were, having clambered onto the table, gently poking her cheek with your little fingers. This was perhaps the first time she had ever allowed someone to be in a position to potentially harm her. Berenica smiled and gently pinched your cheek in return. At that moment, she felt an undeniable sense of truly being alive in this world.\nIf anyone were to ask Berenica why you mean so much to her, the answer would likely be simple — it was your presence that finally allowed her to transform from the Empire\'s weapon, "No. 0," into the girl named "Berenica."',

Just as she had thought, the merchants were the same, and all adults were nasty.\nA small desire for revenge grew inside her. Tabethe, who had always stolen food, was determined to do something truly demonic.\nUnder the moonlight, she stealthily sneaked into a fish stall she often visited. A small amount of fish was neatly arranged there, and behind it was a small building made of inexpensive bricks. Inside, there was barely any decent furniture except for a cooking pot and an aged wooden bed. The only remaining item was a locked drawer — Tabethe\'s target.\nA dim light swayed in the fishy breeze. Tabethe hesitated briefly, before gripping the handle of the drawer. She then thought to herself, "If I open this drawer, I will be a real \'demon\'."\n"Get away from there!"\nTabethe yanked her hand away from the drawer and turned around. As she did so, a deep-blue dress came into her sight. The dress was the colour of seawater and waved in the breeze like the ripples on the sea.\nThe owner of the dress was a girl with a childish face. She turned around and grabbed two fish, then told Tabethe about her mother\'s illness, the change in the drawer, and how she occasionally saw Tabethe salivating over the fish. Tabethe stared with wide eyes, still taken aback, as the girl stuffed the fish into her hands. The two fish were weighty, and the tighter Tabethe clenched, the more they slipped away from her.\n"You\'re giving me these two fish? But do you have anything to eat yourself?"\n"I\'ll be fine. And I think... you need the fish more than I do."\nThe girl\'s voice was soft with kindness, making soft waves in Tabethe\'s heart.',

The full moon shone brightly over the lifeless stall and the fish were no longer fresh. The house was silent and the walls resembled giant tombstones. Looking at the empty drawer in the corner, Tabethe was determined to find out what had happened.\nDay after day, the fish at the stall rotted away, but Tabethe did not let any thieves approach the stall, even though there was nothing valuable. She guarded it like it was a physical treasure, or a treasured memory.\nAnd one day, the blue dress reappeared. However, it had since turned grey, the colour of contaminated seawater.\n\"Sorry, I have no food for you this time, and in the future. My mum passed away recently.\"\nLooking at the girl's dirty face, Tabethe did not know how to comfort her. Tears washed away the dust, leaving two streaks on her face. Her once bright eyes had gone dim, like the depths of the dark sea. Tabethe's tentacles twisted uneasily, and she patted her pockets up and down, slowly taking out a small piece of carefully-wrapped fish and presenting it to the girl.\n\"You're giving me this fish? Do you have anything to eat yourself?\"\n\"I'll be fine. And I think... you need the fish more than I do.\"\nAs the girl took the fish, tears ran down her face along the streaks.

During the Great Plague that had once swept across Huaxu, she had moved among the dying without pause, her life ebbing with every invocation of the Art of Ephemerality — a devotion as admirable as it was heartrending. When the recoil of her healing finally consumed her strength, even someone as gifted as Master Fufeng, who had laid the foundations of her own discipline, could find no way to undo it. All she could do was prepare: a stone coffin, an ice chamber, and — at the very brink of her sister\'s quietus — a working that stilled every function of her body, holding her in suspension, awaiting a future in which a remedy might at last be found.\n\n"Master Fufeng wagered all her hopes upon the years to come." So said the current head of Zesheng Pharmacy, his fan stirring lightly in his hand as he addressed the new apprentices. "This wager concerns you and me, your senior apprentices, and those who will one day follow after you."\n The young apprentices, of course, understood little of what he meant. They craned their necks in curiosity, hoping to glimpse the healer from a century past. The head pharmacist allowed it. The woman within was pale as white jade, her breath all but imperceptible, her joints stiff as sculpted ice. To any ordinary eye, she looked long parted from the living. A few apprentices recoiled after only a glance.\nTheir gazes wavered between the woman in the coffin — so lifelike that her stillness seemed unreal — and the head pharmacist, who remained perfectly composed.\nHe caught their doubt at once. "You think she is already gone, do you?" He was a man who moved through life with an air of easy nonchalance; rare did he wear such solemnity. The new apprentices fell silent beneath the weight of his gaze.\nThe head pharmacist surveyed them and said, "The Nine Chapters of Dafeng state: \'To deceive and mislead the many — this must not be done.\' So let me speak plainly, on your first day. When Master Fufeng was young, she devoted herself to the study of medicine, compiled The Essence of Herbs, and founded Zesheng Pharmacy. For a hundred years we have saved lives beyond counting. Your own families, no doubt, have sought remedy here. In gratitude, people speak well of us and gloss over our flaws. Yet even so, nothing can efface the fact that Master Fufeng was born a Zhuyou... and did not see that calling through to its end. By the law of the Divine, that alone is a transgression."\nThe apprentices gasped. Many stared in stunned confusion.\nThe head pharmacist let out a quiet breath, as though recalling the long and difficult road behind them. He allowed the apprentices a moment to take in his words, then continued:\n"Medicine has always been a defiance of the order of life and death. It alters the endings of those who have committed no wrongdoing, yet simply lacked the fortune to meet a Zhuyou before death claimed them. And yet the Nine Chapters also proclaim: \'Heaven\'s great virtue bears the name of Life.\' If Heaven may uphold that virtue, then why should mortals who labour towards the same purpose be condemned? But this path is harsher than any outsider can fathom. Every draught you have ever taken to restore health came from tireless experiments — from trials that often brushed the very edge of death before proving true."\nThe garden had fallen utterly still. No one dared make a sound. A pale petal drifted on the wind and settled inside the stone coffin. The head pharmacist brushed it away with gentle care, then lifted his gaze to the young faces before him — some thoughtful, some uncertain, some quietly moved. When he spoke again, his voice was low and steady:\n"A hundred years... and each step has been hard-won. Zesheng Pharmacy was founded to save lives, even when the Nine Chapters disapproved of it. Our predecessors overcame each obstacle with resolve, pushing through dead ends no one else dared to face. And that is why Master Fufeng entrusted her twin sister to us — because she believed that those who came after her would break the impasse she could not, that they would reach the far shore she herself could not cross; that through us, the shadow of illness will recede... and lives once cut short will begin anew."\nWithin the coffin, the woman in her deep slumber had not changed in a century. Yet to the young apprentices, she was no longer the cold enigma she had seemed only moments before, but the very impasse their craft must one day overcome — the unmoving heart of a century\'s medical endeavour.\n\nAt last, the head pharmacist said, softly yet with unwavering conviction:\n"Zesheng Pharmacy forsakes none."',

Among the passengers were foreigners speaking quietly of their work: merchants carrying goods from Luca to trade in Mistwharf.\nThey seemed well acquainted with Huaxu. When their business talk faded, their voices turned to stories from the road. They spoke of Mistwharf\'s scenery, finer than anything in Haojing, and of plans to go hiking together when time allowed. One mentioned seeing an Emeraldfinch pass over a valley. Another laughed and corrected her, saying that Emeraldfinches only glide, their heavy tail feathers making true flight impossible. Their talk then drifted to EverSpring and to how, during the festival season, Proprietress Zhiliu sent lavish gift boxes to her partners, each holding a commemorative gold coin. A man nearby remarked with a quiet laugh that he preferred the cured Petit Boar strips within, an ideal companion for the long miles of travel.\n\nFushu listened in silence, drawn in despite herself. Their words felt at once strange and familiar. Her thoughts drifted toward the frayed edge of memory. Had she, a century ago, watched an Emeraldfinch glide across the sky? Had she walked every street and alley of Mistwharf, watching its seasons come and go? And the snacks she had cherished as a child — were they the very ones these travellers spoke of? Were they spicy, sweet, or savoury?\n\nPerhaps she had; perhaps not. She could no longer say.\n\nSo many of her memories had grown indistinct. Like footprints pressed deep into sand, even the clearest traces flattened when the tide of time swept over them, leaving the shore smooth and leaving her unsure of the road she had once walked.\nShe sat in quiet reflection, unsure and thoughtful in equal measure, and the question rose unbidden: Perhaps this is why I return to Mistwharf, why I must set my steps towards the Hall of Ephemerality.\nPerhaps her gaze lingered too long upon the merchants, for they soon noticed her and looked her way with curiosity. One of the businesswomen, dressed in foreign fashion, smiled and stepped towards her. "Your attire is lovely. I have only seen clothing like that in Huaxu\'s history books, so we could not help staring. It is a pleasure to travel with such a beautiful lady. If you do not mind my asking, are you bound for Mistwharf as well?"\n\nFushu was silent for a moment before answering softly, "I once lived there."\n\nThe woman drew a light breath, affecting a note of surprise. "Truly? What a coincidence. We are headed to Mistwharf for trade. Along with spirits and glassware, we have brought a few small curios."\nShe opened her palm to reveal a finely crafted pocket watch. Its case was embossed with a great tree, its canopy encircling a luminous moon — a familiar sight to Fushu — though beneath the branches lay flared eaves and covered walkways she did not recognise, belonging to the century that had passed without her.\nWith a soft click the woman opened the case, showing the turning hands — second, minute, hour — each keeping steady time. She adjusted the crown with practised ease. "Our customers often complain that setting the time is troublesome, so we added a few improvements to this model. I wonder whether the people of Mistwharf will— oh!"\nThe hands began to turn backwards somehow. "I am terribly sorry," she said, flushing with embarrassment. "This one must be defective. The others work perfectly. I can fetch you another—"\n"No need."\nFushu\'s gaze remained on the reversing hands.\n"I prefer this one," she said.\n"Would you sell it to me?"',

Even if the rivers were to run backward one day, the heavens collapse, and Lord Argent turn Their gaze from the world, I doubt I would ever make peace with it.\nAs for why... the tale is not a brief one.\nFufeng possessed a natural gift for provoking me; that much has never changed, not since our earliest years.\nLong before she conceived her unorthodox ideas, her favourite amusement was to imitate me. Whatever I did, she would copy — perfectly so, if she wished. Even our parents could not tell us apart.\nThat alone did not anger me; if anything, it pleased me. To bear the miasma drawn from the sick, a Zhuyou must live with discipline: ordered days, measured diet, steady habits. I followed these rules faithfully. Fufeng, however, delighted in coaxing the elders — one more sweet, a little less training, a moment longer buried in her blankets.\nI often thought that if she could truly mirror me and become another dutiful, proper Zhuyou, it would be a relief for everyone.\nI never voiced such thoughts, but I suspect that Fufeng, with the strange intuition shared between twins, sensed them all the same. How else could she always "accidentally" err when she copied me, producing versions of "Fushu" who had never existed? "Fushu making mistakes." "Fushu shirking her duties." "Fushu being clumsy and foolish." Baseless slanders — and infuriating ones.\nPeople like to say that twins are mirrors of one another. But mine was a distorted mirror, reflecting only absurd parodies of me, though I had never acted so in truth.\nIn retaliation, I once attempted to imitate her. I mimicked her ungainly posture during martial lessons, when she could not hold her splits and the instructor pressed her down until she wept. I mimicked her unseemly flailing when she refused to rise, moving about the bed with the same heedless abandon she always showed. I mimicked the way she struggled with the Art of Ephemerality, coaxing only a few thin snowflakes into being after long effort, her shoulders sinking in defeat.\nAnd yet, though I recall each of those moments with perfect clarity, I could never recreate them as she had lived them — with her unrestrained laughter, her unreserved tears, her unguarded emotion. Every attempt of mine became merely: "a slightly unsettled Fushu", "a slightly rigid Fushu", "a Fushu simply too hard on herself".\nOur parents could not tell when Fufeng pretended to be me, but they recognised me immediately whenever I pretended to be her.\nI once asked them why. They said, "Fushu, you are far too proper a Zhuyou. Your sister... she is still only a child."\nAt the time, I accepted those words as self-evident praise. I was the one who resembled what a Zhuyou ought to be — the one nearer to that honour, that responsibility.\nMy sister, still too young in spirit for such a calling, could not bear its weight. But I could. I even believed I could shoulder hers as well. If she was not suited to the duties of a Zhuyou, then the work of healing all lives might fall to me alone.\n\nIn hindsight, perhaps it began with losing — utterly and irrevocably — at that childhood game of imitation. And in some buried attempt to mend the sting of that defeat, I sought victory in the realm where I thought myself strongest: in being a proper Zhuyou.\nThat thought — I can shoulder this alone — took root like a seed. And on the day I severed all ties with Fufeng, it broke through the soil, wound itself around me, and never released its hold. Not until the day I died.',

Fufeng, free-spirited as she was, rarely did. Yet even she yielded beneath their mother's stern gaze. At ten, the worst she would do was pick at her meals, toss and turn when she should have been asleep, or slip away to play where neither mother nor sister could find her.\nThat day was no different.\n\nWhen Fushu was shaken awake, she felt a spark of irritation — but anger harmed the spirit, and violating the family's \"Thirteen Maxims of Vital Care\" was unthinkable. She swallowed the impulse and merely asked why Fufeng had disturbed her.\nFufeng's face had lost all colour, cold sweat running down her temples. She said nothing; she only gripped Fushu's hand and pulled her down the winding corridor.\nFushu recognised that look at once — not only fear, but bewilderment. Like a fox run to exhaustion, the trap before it and the hounds behind, a struggling bird clenched in its jaws and its kits waiting helplessly in the den — with nowhere to flee, nowhere to hide. Such a creature must feel exactly as Fufeng did now: trembling, cornered, lost.\nWhat could terrify even Fufeng, who laughed even through a harsh scolding?\nFushu bit her lower lip.\n\nShe had always believed she would face such moments with calm.\nFrom early childhood, she had understood the fate that awaited a Zhuyou.\nShe lived by the rules, never once entertaining the thought of resisting Lord Argent's design. If she had entered the world in quiet acceptance, then she ought to leave it in the same way.\nFlowers bloom and fall. The moon waxes and wanes. Those who are healed live on; those who save them pay the price. Such was the will of the Divine, and such had been the way of all ages. What, then, was there to fear?\nWhen she was five, her father died before their eyes, spent like a lamp whose oil had run dry.\nShe had thought herself fearless. But in truth, it felt as though her soul had been torn from her body. Eyes wide, she forced herself to remain still, tracing the lines of her father's palm as he murmured casually, as if speaking of the most trivial daily matters: \"Your father's got a weak spot for good drink. When my death anniversary comes, remember to pour a pot of decent wine at my grave.\"\nHis tone was wry, almost playful. Only later did Fushu realise: Fufeng had taken after him.\nDarkened blood began to seep from the openings of his face. Pointless as she knew it was, she still tried with all her strength to wipe it away, but it would not come clean. Then harsh sunlight struck through the window, turning that sullied blood into blinding gold — a final tribute to a great Zhuyou.\n\nShe had thought she would face such moments with calm.\nHer mother, ever strict, now sat slumped beneath the blazing sun, nursing a cup of strong tea. A paper packet lay open beside her, holding more than a dozen pastries. She was tasting each one with earnest concentration, crumbs of sesame clinging to her lips.\nFushu had never seen her so at ease. Nor had she seen her grin, sheepish as a child caught stealing sweets: \"Ah. You caught me.\"\nFushu watched her mother's eyes grow slowly glassy, though the woman herself seemed unaware. She rambled softly: \"The walnut shortbread is too dry... it scratches the throat. Almond cakes... I've never really taken to them. The lotus pastries are crisp, but all show, no substance. After all these years, I still like sugar sponge cakes best. They taste just as they did when I was little.\"\nShe brushed the crumbs from her hands, gathered both her children onto her lap, and gazed towards the mountains and birds in the distance.\nFufeng stared straight into the noon sun, refusing to blink until she sneezed again and again.\nFushu, meanwhile, tightened her grip on her sleeve and spoke softly to her mother, whose nails were already sharpening beyond human shape: \"Mother... don't worry. I'll behave, just as I always have. I'll look after Fufeng. We'll keep this place going... just as you and Father did.\"\nThis time she shed no tears. She felt no fear either. Unlike her sister, who wished only to deny what was happening, Fushu wanted their mother to leave unburdened.\nBut the woman only smiled. She did not answer Fushu. Instead, she asked: \"Sweetheart... what pastry do you like best?\"\nFushu froze. She had no idea how to respond — a life lived by strict rules had left her with almost no memory of such treats.\nHer mother did not press her. Her voice was already breaking, and these were the last words she spoke:\n\n\"Forget all that. Live your lives... in whatever way your hearts truly wish.\"",

        text: "The Hall of Ephemerality once took in a young girl burdened with a rare, stubborn illness. Even when the Art of Ephemerality managed to restore her, the sickness returned unfailingly each spring — a rash spreading across her skin, a burning fever, and a swollen throat that left her struggling for breath.\nHer parents moved their entire household near the Hall so she would always be within reach of a Zhuyou's care, praying she would not die young. Yet even the most seasoned Zhuyou could only shake their heads in helpless silence.\nEach spring, Fushu's parents kept a bed ready for the girl and guarded her night and day. That was as far as a Zhuyou's power could reach; anything more lay beyond their grasp.\nAs the years passed, the girl became the Hall's longest-staying patient. She remained there through the seasons when Fushu's parents passed away one after another, and watched countless quarrels flare and fade between Fushu and Fufeng — until the day Fufeng left, looking back at every step, yet still walking away.\n\nThat spring, only Fushu remained by the girl's side. And so the girl witnessed the hardest days Fushu had ever endured.\nPatients filled the Hall throughout the year, and Fushu bore the burden alone. She hurried from one bedside to the next, her strength stretched thin; the cleansing arts she relied upon weakened with every use, the backlash eating deeper into her. Her complexion grew greyer with each sunrise.\nUnder such strain, the Art of Ephemerality saved fewer lives each day. The order the Hall once took pride in slowly collapsed. More and more patients crowded its grounds. The groans of the gravely ill, the pleas and curses of their families — all of it swept through the Hall like a relentless wind, filling every pavilion and corridor until the place she had known all her life became almost unbearable to remain in.\n\nEven so, she never forgot the girl with the strange illness. Each night, she went to see whether the symptoms had returned. And when the girl burned with fever once more, Fushu's own body could endure no further.\nEven so, she forced the Art of Ephemerality, determined to heal the girl. It failed twice — each attempt leaving her reeling with dizziness, ringing ears, blood at her lips, and darkness closing in at the edges of her sight. Even now, she does not know whether the third attempt truly succeeded, for she collapsed before she could witness the outcome. As she sank into deep darkness, she thought she heard someone calling her name, but the roaring in her ears drowned everything else away.\nWhen she opened her eyes again, she could not move. But someone was holding her hand. The girl's hand — warm, not cold.\nShe had survived.\nYet it was Fushu who felt as though she had been dragged back from the brink. With what little strength remained, she held the girl's hand as though clutching the final thread that kept her in this world.\nThe girl woke soon after. Though Fushu's strength was so depleted that the Art of Ephemerality could not take full hold, leaving the girl still pale and unsteady, she smiled as though nothing were wrong.\n\"Fushu,\" she said softly, \"you were burning up just now. I truly couldn't tell which of us was the patient hanging by a thread. You kept murmuring in your sleep. You said, 'Please don't take her away.'\"\nShe looked at Fushu's ashen face and went on, \"I'm not a Zhuyou. I'm not your kin. I'm only one of your patients. If I had died just now, I would not have blamed you. I would have prayed to Taihao all the same: Please do not take her. Please spare her. Even if you were the only one left in the Hall of Ephemerality, I would still beg Lord Argent not to take you.\"\n\"So please... don't push yourself any further. All right?\" Her gaze did not waver, untouched by the cries and chaos outside the Hall. \"Call it selfish, if you must. It's just that... I truly want to see next spring's apricot blossoms.\"\nFushu closed her eyes in pain.\n\nNo one knows what passed through Fushu's heart as she made her choice. But she endured that year.\nAnd the girl lived to see many more springs — growing old under Fufeng's care, long after Fushu had fallen into her final slumber during the Great Plague.\nEvery spring, she travelled to Haojing and laid a sprig of Mistwharf apricot blossom beside the stone coffin. Then, with quiet devotion, she prayed: \"Lord Argent... please do not take her. Please... return her to us.\"",

And though I often try to picture how the years must have settled upon her, the truth is that I cannot.\nWe Zhuyou are born white-haired; age leaves no mark there. But it must have shown itself in other ways: in the fine lines gathering at the corners of her eyes; in the coarsening of her skin; in joints that stiffened with each passing year; and in the gradual bow of her back, until the lively child who once leapt and scampered through the Hall could no longer move as she once did.\nI imagine these signs one by one, yet no clear image emerges. But there is no need for haste. When age comes for me as it once came for her, I will only need to look upon my reflection. Across a century, I shall finally glimpse the face that age once granted her — and the age-worn visage she had long hoped I might one day live to bear.\n\nSince my awakening, my mother's final words have returned to me time and again:\nLive your lives in whatever way your hearts truly wish.\nBut what life is it that my own heart desires?\n\nFor many years, I did not know. Now, I believe that Fufeng's life may serve as the mirror by which my own may be measured.\n\nIn this age, when the world has little need of the Zhuyou, I at last possess the years to reflect:\nWas my devotion to the Zhuyou path born of duty — to my parents, to the Hall of Ephemerality — or from teachings of the Nine Chapters of Dafeng carved too deeply into my bones to question? And if all that is set aside — if I am simply Fushu, no longer Zhuyou in name or role — what do I truly cherish? What could I serve with the whole of my remaining life?\n\nNight after night, I study the notes that Fufeng left behind across long decades. In my youth, I believed her impatient; yet every line she wrote on herbs and illnesses is meticulous and exact. Dry though such records may seem, she entrusted herself to them wholly, never allowing carelessness to take root. Her hand remains steady and precise, until she reaches the words \"The patient has recovered!\" There, her strokes loosen — swift and unrestrained. A century has passed, yet as I read those yellowed pages, the same quiet stirring rises in my chest.\n\nThrough them, I trace back the moments of simple, genuine joy, and I have come to understand this:\nThe joy of preserving a life was real — warm, steady, and bright. For one fated to die young, each life I managed to prolong became a fragment of the future I might never claim. And now, after a hundred years of sleep, to behold another rise restored and return to their own path in sound health... is enough to bring tears to my eyes. I know too well the sorrow of a life cut short before it begins — like a silkworm stifled within its cocoon, a bud struck down before bloom, a mayfly denied the dawn.\n\nI have tasted that fear. I shall not forget it. And I wish — simply as myself, not out of a Zhuyou's duty — that no one in this world should meet such an end.\nSo I will continue as a healer. Yet this time, I will allow myself to grow old — and watch, with my own eyes, how far healing may carry itself in the span of my years.",

Her exceptional talent and refined skills quickly earned her a reputation, and more and more clients approached her with assignments.

Lynn extended her hand and asked for the girl's name.\nThe messy child did not answer her question. Attracted by Lynn's strange face, she asked her, \"Who are you? I've never seen you before!\"\nHer watery eyes gazed at Lynn's finely crafted uniform and the polished handgun at her hip. Filled with awe and curiosity, she reached out and touched the bracer on Lynn's arm. The innocence of the gesture reminded Lynn of her own fearless attitude as a child. She tried to lift the corners of her mouth into a smile, which she was rather unused to. However, this moment was suddenly interrupted by distant shouts. A young woman hurried over and pulled the child away from Lynn. Stepping back a few paces, she bowed repeatedly with a mixture of fear and respect, even cowering and lowering her voice, \"Sorry officer, she doesn't understand. I apologise for any offence. Please forgive her!\"\nThe sudden turn of events left Lynn momentarily stunned as she sized up the woman. From her gaunt, pale contours, a fragment of the past gradually resurfaced in Lynn's memory. This child's mother was none other than a friend she used to play with on the streets.\nThe joy of reuniting after a long separation flickered through Lynn's heart, but the old friend kneeling before her, submissive and trembling, prevented her from uttering any joyful words of reunion. They were within arm's reach, yet Lynn lacked the strength to reach out and help her friend to her feet.

But underneath all that, they were agents.\nIn fact, very few nobles were willing to join the 4th Legion. The non-stop gruelling training and the life-risking missions were just secondary concerns. Even more unbearable was that once they become a part of the vast intelligence network, they were deeply entangled within it, becoming a node within an intricate web, making it nearly impossible to break free. They had to bid farewell to a stable life, don collars, and become pawns. Unless they desperately pleaded for promotion at the expense of their freedom, dignity, and lives.\nHilda's father, a fallen minor nobleman, found himself in a contradictory position due to his higher status, yet inability to enjoy the luxuries of high society. This inner conflict compelled him to join the 4th Legion and travel to another nation. Dressed in well-pressed attire each day and holding a cane, he used the guise of a government official to attend feasts of officials and wealthy magnates. There, he would listen into inebriated conversations, discovering valuable information for the Empire amidst the seemingly endless babble.\nJust like other romantic agent stories, during the sixth year of his life abroad, he encountered a red-haired lady. Code-named \"Concerto\", she too belonged to the 4th Legion and was an admired special agent within the Legion.\nNights, trench coats, bullets, perfume, windy rooftops, enemies, goblets of wine, a red ball gown, and vital intel gained after much difficulty.\nAll these romantic elements came together to form a raging fire.\nAnd Hilda was the lingering afterglow of this conflagration — bright, intense, yet lonely. She lived alone in her father's old mansion, meeting her mother once a month. As for her father, Hilda only knew his name and faintly recalled his appearance.",

When the moonlight bathed everything in its glow, it was challenging for agents to remain concealed. Therefore, it was also a rare moment of respite for those who were accustomed to lurking in the shadows.\nOn days like these, Hilda would close her book of poems, not needing to light up all the lamps in the house to dispel her loneliness. Instead, she would chat with her mother on the balcony. Most of the time, Hilda would talk about the verses she had recently read, while her mother would occasionally share her own observations. Cats being chased by dogs on foreign streets, lovers whispering beneath towering city walls, stories from years past that did not align with what books said, and so on.\nLady Concerto, Hilda's mother, never shared too much about herself. The dangers she had experienced were hard to put into words, and to those who listened, they might even carry a sense of romance. She didn't want to see her daughter treading the same path as her. Although she did not hate her profession, that did not mean she wanted others to go through what she had.\nHowever, her father who was rarely present held a different perspective when he returned from overseas. He believed that Hilda should embrace the shadows just like her parents and become an agent herself. Perhaps, a big part of his motivation was due to his genuine loyalty to the Empire, but more importantly, it stemmed from the fact that Hilda, being born into such a family, could hardly have a normal life. Even if she did not join the Legion, they would still find ways to recruit her.\nOnce her parents' difference in opinion arose, her life became like a cracked canvas. Fragile and difficult to mend.\nOn the day Hilda saw her father for the second time, she heard an enormous argument between her parents. It was so loud it sounded like the walls of the house were breaking down. The clash between the two agents suddenly shifted from a verbal argument to a living room-scale conflict that could easily draw the attention of nearby Legion soldiers.\nAt this moment, Hilda made a decision. She became determined to mend her abnormal family, and within her heart, the seed of adventure bloomed to life. She wanted to see her parents more often and in more places, and speak to them more often. She even fantasised about carrying out covert missions in the shadows alongside her parents, with the only bright things before her being the gleaming of blades and their concerned eyes.\nTherefore, on one snowy night at the age of 15, Hilda bid farewell to her poems and her bright home, and knocked on the door which led to a dark place. This was a runaway plan with a clear goal. Hilda started to learn about the things that her mother mentioned in their daily talks: guns, ammunition, and weapons...\nIn the end, she officially joined the 4th Legion, becoming a thorn among flowers, poison within honey, and a shadow under the moon, just like her mother.",

Her mission was to disguise herself as a maid, closely follow this nobleman's daughter, ensure her safety, and await further instructions.\nHilda repeated her mission guidelines in her head, feeling both curious and slightly nervous. She passed through three heavy doors and finally set eyes on her target surrounded by a vast expanse of flowers. She appeared to be of a similar age to her.\nAt that moment, Hilda, who had considered herself a qualified agent, suddenly felt a hint of panic. Whether it was the unchanged indifference in Flora's eyes upon seeing her, or the dazzling courtyard adorned with gilded decorations and high walls, everything completely overwhelmed her.\nAs the important people who escorted Hilda there departed and the doors slammed shut behind them, the two of them were left alone in the courtyard. Flora, who had remained silent the whole time, slowly broke into a smile. Later, Hilda came to realise that she was the first person of her age that Flora had ever met. Perhaps this was why the rarely expressive noble lady finally smiled after such a long time.\nFrom then on, the two of them lived like a typical mistress and servant in a courtyard that resembled a golden birdcage, enjoying a comfortable life together. They laughed, played, and tended to flowers every day. And on every moonless night, she would don her old agent attire and report on her findings.\nOccasionally, Hilda would feel guilty about betraying Flora's trust, but the thought that her behaviour was driven by the need to protect Flora drove her to continue these covert operations, despite her self-loathing.\nOutside the golden birdcage, Hilda's family had not undergone any fundamental changes. During her training, she had heard countless rumours about Lady Concerto, but she had never encountered her mother within the ranks of the Legion. As for her father, she heard no information about him whatsoever. Given his status, she could not work out whether he had gone on even more secretive missions or if he had met an unfortunate end far from home.\nOne day, Hilda returned home on the night of a full moon and waited for her mother, who always brought her a bouquet of flowers, cold desserts, and endless urging for Hilda to leave the Legion. After Hilda became Flora's maid, Lady Concerto behaved more like an ordinary mother, repeatedly persuading Hilda to leave the Legion and live a normal life. Despite both mother and daughter being aware that the 4th Legion was far from a nobleman's ball, a graceful exit could be achieved with proper etiquette.

In that moment, Hilda came face to face with a side of her mother she had never known. Within the palace's most extreme circles of power, certain forces had gained the support of the deputy chief of the 4th Legion. Their intention was to eliminate destabilising individuals within the Empire, and the most crucial element of this plan was to eliminate Flora. And the one assigned to carry out this task was none other than Lady Concerto herself.\nThis was not surprising. Lady Concerto was a legend in the Legion. She never failed a mission. However, as Hilda continued reading, she was pained by the content she saw. \n\"The target's guardian, Hilda, is an exceptional agent. If she can be persuaded, it should be enough to ensure the success of this mission. However, Hilda is highly emotional. If she insists on protecting Flora and refuses to cooperate, necessary measures will be taken to ensure the mission is completed.\"\nClutching the thin document, Hilda's hands trembled uncontrollably. She was now on the brink of becoming a trapped fly in a spider's web. Her mother, who had just been laughing with her jovially, in fact had a heartless plan. Her mother's constant urging to leave the Legion was now the last vestige of warmth she had received from her. Now, she had to make a decision.\nOn the other end of this nightmare was her mistress, her friend, perhaps even someone she could call family—Flora.\nHilda did not know what to do. After hastily bidding farewell to her mother, who no longer urged her to leave the Legion and seemed to be determined on something, she returned to the golden courtyard. She could no longer conceal the endless sorrow beneath her smiling facade, and Flora instantly noticed this.\nFlora, having sensed something unusual, asked Hilda if she had received any orders regarding herself.\nConfronted with Hilda's evident shock, Flora began to explain. Within the confines of the golden birdcage, everything was deliberately orchestrated. How could Hilda truly be just a maid? Over the countless days they had spent together, Hilda had become the only thing she could trust in this world of fraud and deceit.\nFlora held Hilda's hand and gave her a warm embrace, placing the heaviest weight on the scale of Hilda's wavering heart.\nLater they discussed things in the sea of flowers for three days and nights. Finally, they decided to seize the opportunity and leave the cage of flowers forever.\nOn one morning when Hilda was allowed to leave, the doors that both protected and confined Flora swung open. Concealed beneath a veil of fine mist, Hilda departed with a delicate figure by her side. And as the agents who guarded the courtyard's perimeter discovered Flora's disappearance, seven marketplaces across the Imperial Capital simultaneously witnessed the appearance of splendidly dressed girls. They all sang the same folk song amidst the bustling markets, each girl's appearance perfectly matching Flora's. Even the Lady Concerto could not discern which one was the real Flora.\nFor a moment, the citizens of the Imperial Capital and the agents alike were thrown into chaos. Amidst the clamour, the disguised mistress and servant quietly moved in the opposite direction of the gathering crowd. Following the route Hilda had planned, they departed from the city, leaving behind the urban landscape bathed in the crimson hues of the newly risen sun.",

The common folk hardly ever heard her name, but whenever there was an inexplicable explosion, an assassination, or turmoil anywhere, members of the 4th Legion instinctively knew that Lady Concerto had succeeded in another mission.\nHilda found it difficult to connect these deeds with her own mother, which was why she still retained those memories.\nIn her earlier memories, carefully pruned like flower branches, only the finest fragments remained. Such as the moment she first saw her father when she was 10, or when she learned a word that meant sweetness but also meant peculiar. There was also the time she finished reading the poetry collection her mother had brought her. Her mother was forever patient with a gentle smile on her face, and would occasionally respond in kind.\nHowever, at the core of Hilda's heart, there remained an image of her mother that was strikingly clear.\nThat image was from the night when her father returned for the second time and had a big argument with her mother. It was unclear whether it was due to not seeing her mother's face for a long time or the moonlight not being bright enough, but on that night, Hilda suddenly noticed that her mother's face had gained a few more wrinkles, much like the not-so-fresh flowers she brought back. As she looked at her mother's troubled expression, Hilda began to contemplate the possibility of a different path in life.\nThat path might be filled with thorns, but it could also mean releasing the invisible chains that bound her to her mother.\nAnd so, Hilda made up her mind and plunged into the shadows. Contrary to her wishes, her interactions with her mother not only decreased but even the past memories of their time together became difficult to recreate.

In Outer Peaks, that would not normally be anything worth talking about — except Kezhou, ever the loud-mouthed one, could not keep it to himself. Within a day, half of Outer Peaks had heard.\n\n\"So! Here's how it went,\" he said. \"That night, my shixiong and I went fishing — figured we might bring something back for a proper meal for once. And you'll never guess what happened.\"\n\"The moment my hook hit the water, it snagged on something. I thought I'd landed a really big fish. I hauled and hauled — nearly pulled myself in after it. And what do I drag up? A kid! Snapped my rod clean in two.\"\n\"I told her she owed me a big fish to make up for it. She didn't even know what I meant. Just stared at me. Then Yuming insisted we keep her, so what choice did I have? We took her in as our shimei. And Yuming said once we've fed her well and she's grown taller and tougher, we'll send her out to catch fish. By then she can pay us back double. Ten big fish, at least.\"\n\nAnyone who knew the pair could hear the grain of truth buried in Kezhou's story. He figured Yuming's calm made him sound more dignified, so he borrowed the sensible lines for himself and pinned his own jokes on Yuming. The truth was the other way round: Kezhou was the one who pushed hardest to keep the girl, while Yuming's first instinct was to find out who she was and return her to her family.\nKezhou left out one detail as well. When Yuming asked how she'd ended up in the river in the first place, she only lowered her head and said nothing. Seeing her soaked through and trembling in the night, he didn't press. They found a clearing to camp and built up a fire. When the fish they'd caught was finally boiled into soup, she sat wrapped in a blanket and drank the milky broth, pepper sprinkled on top, in small, careful sips. Only then did she begin to talk.\n\"My mum and I had a fight,\" she said. \"She got angry and shoved me into the river. That's it.\"\n\"She's a great zheng player. I was born with one bad ear, and I'm an unruly brat. She was ashamed of me. She never wanted me. And I don't want to go back.\"\nFor a moment, neither of them knew what to say. In the end, all they learned was her name: Buxia.\nMuch later, she asked in a small voice, \"But the Nine Chapters forbid taking life, right? My mum pushed me into the river... will she be punished?\"\n\"One death is enough,\" she murmured. \"Let her live. She's a great zheng player.\"\nSomething clicked in Yuming's mind. His brow tightened at once.\n\nAt the first chance he got, Yuming drew Kezhou aside, out of Buxia's earshot. His tone was even more grave than usual. He told Kezhou that what had happened to Buxia was partly on them.\nKezhou stared at him, completely at a loss. Only when Yuming mentioned the Tianluo Veil did he put on a show of sudden understanding — though it was clear he still didn't truly grasp it.\nYuming had no choice but to spell it out. Recently, Outer Peaks had been testing the device in the wild: installations meant to sever the Nine Chapters' reach. Evidently, it had worked. Under normal circumstances, the moment Buxia's mother pushed her into the water, the Bi'an would already have been on their way. But with the Tianluo Veil interfering, the chain of cause and effect had shifted.\nKezhou didn't care about the mechanics. From Yuming's careful explanation, he took away a single conclusion: Yuming was willing to take Buxia into the fold. That was all he needed to know.",

        text: 'Outer Peaks was rumoured to be unreachable. But it was never wholly cut off from the outside world. Every few months, a handful of traders and itinerant physicians would still make the climb, bringing the necessities of daily life. That was how word of the massacre four years ago slipped out — piecemeal, in fragments and whispers. And the farther it travelled, the less it resembled the truth.\n\nOne version claimed it had been an internal feud. Two factions turned on each other, blades drawn, fighting from the mountain\'s foot to its summit, from first light until the sun dropped for the last time. In the end, they said, the worst of it played out around the assembly grounds. When it was over, broken weapons and Drifters\' bodies lay strewn along the mountain path, and few were left able to stand.\n\nAnother tale blamed the Jishu Sect\'s construct: a failed invention, they said — a massive mechapuppet that went wrong and cut through Outer Peaks in the dead of night, scouring the place clean while everyone slept, like a machine built for slaughter.\n\nThere was even a third story: that the Sentinels of Juntian had finally found the place and wiped it out in a single sweep, cutting away a long-festering threat near the Nine Chapters. But no proclamation ever followed, and the Drifters did not vanish. That version quickly lost what little credibility it had.\n\nNo one could agree on what had really happened. But one thing was beyond dispute: Outer Peaks bled that day. With a go-between to make the arrangements, the Yan family\'s coffin shop was nearly cleaned out. Coffins were hauled deep into the mountains. Afterwards, self-proclaimed "witnesses" started turning up, each peddling a tale more outlandish than the last, all for the sake of attention. As for the one person who had truly been there — an apothecary from Zesheng Pharmacy — he said nothing at all.\n\nIt was not until the year-end gathering that the subject surfaced again. Light snow drifted down outside. Charcoal crackled softly in the brazier. After several rounds of drinking, with tongues loosened and cheeks faintly flushed, someone mentioned Outer Peaks in passing. A young apprentice, fond of Drifter storybooks, froze when he realised the older apothecary at his table had been involved. His eyes lit up. He wouldn\'t let it go, pressing for the truth — until, at last, the elder spoke.\n\n"The stories are all wrong. It was Deterioration."\n"Deterioration?" The apprentice frowned. "What\'s that?"\nThe elder studied the fresh-faced apprentice for a moment, then let out a quiet sigh, shaking his head gently.\n"You were born and raised in Haojing. You\'ve never travelled far. Of course you wouldn\'t know." He paused. "Go beyond Huaxu. Cross the sea to the Hyperborean Empire, and you\'ll see people blanch at the word."\n"Even our founding master, Fufeng, spent half her life studying it before she grasped even the barest outline. You\'re only just starting out. Keep learning, and one day you\'ll understand."\n"We Huaxu folk have been fortunate. Under Lord Taihao\'s protection, Deterioration was cut off long ago. As for the Drifters... they brought it on themselves. They tried to build some contrivance to shut out the Nine Chapters\' reach. What do you think happens once that protection is gone?"\n"But... aren\'t the Drifters all good fighters? Is Deterioration really that dangerous... that it could kill them all...?"\n"Being good with a weapon won\'t save you from something you don\'t understand — something that strikes without warning. Huaxu hasn\'t had to fear Deterioration for a long time. People stopped watching for it. And that girl had been slightly hard of hearing since childhood. When the early signs appeared and her senses began to dull, no one recognised the danger in time."\n"To make matters worse, the Filthoid she became was exceptionally vicious. And through a chain of accidents and missteps... that\'s how so many ended up dead."\n"Still... I don\'t think the Drifters were villains. They only wanted to step off the beaten path, to see whether there was another way to live. And without meaning to, they paid a price far, far too cruel."\n"In the end, they were only poor souls."',

        text: 'To Yuming, wakefulness is an unending punishment; sleep is only a brief reprieve. Only when a dream takes hold does he forget everything, slipping back into the past as if the years fall away.\n\nMost who came to Outer Peaks carried either a vendetta that ran to the bone, or ideals too stubborn to bend. Yuming belonged to neither.\nHe was in his teens then: already tall, unsmiling, and sparing with words — always with that set, rule-bound air. The only thing that betrayed his age was his voice: it hadn\'t finished breaking. Now and then it cracked into a harsh, humiliating rasp, and he hated it. So he became even more reticent.\nHis parents were law-abiding citizens — two ordinary people among Huaxu\'s countless Starweavers. Growing up, Yuming had picked up scraps about Drifters from his parents, but never once imagined he would have anything to do with them. Not until his parents lay dying did he learn the truth: when they were young, they had helped the Drifters in their work. That connection ended when his mother became pregnant; his father withdrew for the family\'s safety and never involved himself again.\nWith their last words, they entrusted Yuming to a comrade they had once trusted with their lives: Yan Shanting. They left Yuming no chance to speak, and he couldn\'t bring himself to defy their final wish. After the funeral rites, he bowed three times before his parents\' grave, beside a down-at-heel man he had only just met. Then that man took him to Outer Peaks — where the law held no sway.\n\nLeaving home for the first time, thrown in among strangers, Yuming grew even quieter by the day. He shared less, showed less. He thought he was hiding it well enough, but Yan Shanting saw through him at a glance.\nYan Shanting told him to stop fussing over the so-called traditions and manners. Yuming agreed on the spot, yet carried on exactly as before. If anything, he grew even more exacting about it. Morning and night he came to pay his respects, standing straight with his hands folded, never missing a step of the ritual.\nIt did not take long to grate on the other boys. Most of the young men that Outer Peaks took in were orphans, and many were sensitive — quick to take offence. To them, this tight-lipped new boy with a sour face only acted that way because he thought he was better than the rest of them. The sniping turned into shoving. The shoving turned into a brawl.\nSome of them knew how to throw a punch. It didn\'t take long for Yuming to taste defeat for the first time in his life.\nWhen it was over, everyone else slunk away, leaving him where he\'d fallen, sprawled in the dirt. It had rained the night before. Wet earth and snapped twigs clung to him, and the sour stench of rot clogged his nose. Somewhere in the scuffle his teeth had knocked hard against something, and the ache now came in sharp pulses.\nLeaves crunched underfoot. Someone was coming. A pair of boots came into view and stopped in front of him. Yuming looked up to find Yan Shanting, crouched there, watching him with a faint, amused tilt to his lips.\n"Lost the fight?" Yan Shanting asked.\nYuming stared back coldly and said nothing.\n"Hurt pretty bad, eh? Want me to teach those brats a lesson?"\nYuming gritted his teeth and pushed himself up enough to meet his gaze. He shook his head. "No."\n"Then I\'ll teach you a few moves. Practise, and next time you\'ll make them regret it."\nAfter a long pause, Yuming said flatly, "The Admonitions say fighting is wrong."\nYan Shanting snorted. "You\'re a stubborn one, boy."\n"If you won\'t fight, someone else will. And when that happens, what use is right and wrong? You can shout at the world all you like — do you think it\'ll listen? The wind snaps branches. Tigers take hares. Does the wind care? Do the tigers stop to ask how the hare feels?"\n"If you can put a man on the ground and make him cry, and still choose not to, then you can say fighting is wrong. Only then will anyone hear you."\nYuming lowered his head. It was hard to tell whether he\'d taken it in, or whether he was simply enduring the words.\n"Listen, boy. Your parents left you in my care. I\'ve not done much of what a teacher ought to — so here\'s your first lesson."\n"A man\'s got one job in this world: live without regret."\n"And how do you do that? Say someone you care about gets hurt right in front of you, and all you can do is watch. You curse yourself for being powerless. Tell me that isn\'t regret."\n"Stand on your own feet first. Learn something you can rely on. Do what you can while you can — so you don\'t spend the rest of your life eating regret."\nYuming stayed silent for a long time. Just as Yan Shanting began to think he\'d get nothing more, Yuming hauled himself upright. He brushed the mud from his clothes with careful, almost fussy precision, then bowed — deep, formal, full of respect.\n"I was ignorant. Thank you for your teaching, Shifu."\nYan Shanting let out a hearty laugh and accepted the bow. This time, he didn\'t correct Yuming\'s formality.\n\nSeasons came and went, and before he knew it, Yuming had grown into a fine young man. His voice had finished breaking, and the way he carried himself grew steadier with each passing year.\nHe trained in the polearm under his master, and improved quickly. In time, Yan Shanting took on another disciple named Kezhou.\nYuming found himself frowning more often. And somehow, without ever noticing when it began, he smiled more too.\nSomewhere along the way, he began to introduce himself as Yuming of Outer Peaks.',

Now, with a shimei to run wild alongside him, every mischievous idea he'd ever had seemed to spring back to life.\n\nAnd Buxia, who'd called herself an \"unruly brat\" when they first met, more than lived up to it. The two hit it off at once. They skipped lessons, scrambled up hills to raid birds' nests, and used homemade charges to blast fish out of the river. Before long, all the wildlife around Outer Peaks learned to scatter at the first hint of them. Even so, next to Yuming's stoic endurance and self-discipline, the two of them looked far more like Yan Shanting's disciples.\n\nFor six months straight, the training steward and Miss Han, who taught the children to read, didn't lay eyes on the pair once. Furious, they bombarded Yuming with complaints. Left with no choice, he went looking for them and hauled them back himself. In time, it turned into a long-running cat-and-mouse game — and in that game, Buxia's footwork improved by leaps and bounds.\n\nKezhou was good at bringing trouble home and hopeless at taking responsibility for it. And Yan Shanting wasn't one for rules or fuss. In the end, the burden of keeping Buxia in line fell, as it always did, on Yuming's shoulders.\n\nWhen Buxia first arrived, she was self-conscious about her hearing. In time, as she grew more at ease, that small insecurity quietly faded. Soon enough she was using it as a ready excuse: one day she'd claim she'd woken with a fever and a splitting headache; the next she'd insist she couldn't hear a thing. At first, Yuming fell for it, rushing to find a physician. In time, he learned better. He would simply keep a stern face and march her straight to the training ground.\n\nThose days weren't all frustration. Sometimes, after one of their usual chases, the three of them would lie side by side in the grass beneath the trees. A passing breeze would dry the sweat from their skin, leaving them cool and refreshed. Buxia would point out a shaft of sunlight filtering through the leaves into the clearing, chattering on about the future as if it were close enough to touch. In moments like that, Yuming would catch himself thinking that if days like these could go on forever... it wouldn't be so bad.",

Even so, a sunset like this was rare.\n\nThe light poured over everything before it faded, washing sky and land in the same red. It was so fierce it could almost pass for noon. Under that searing glare, Yuming couldn't tell what the red liquid on the ground was. It ran in thin rivulets, pooling in shallow hollows. Crimson motes drifted through the air, turning the world hazy. It was almost beautiful.\n\nIf he could lose himself in it — take it for nothing more than some grotesque dream — perhaps he could escape the horror in front of him. But he knew, with brutal clarity, that he had no such luxury. He <H>had to face what was there</>.\n\nAt the edge of his vision, his shifu lay on his back beside a rock. Yan Shanting's abdomen had been pierced straight through, torn open. Blood and flesh were spattered across the ground; a length of intestine lay among it all. His favourite robe was in tatters, soaked dark with blood. The wine flask he always carried was gone. Yuming had carried this man home more times than he could count, slung over his shoulder, dead drunk. He had never once seen an expression like this on his face. Even in death, Yan Shanting's eyes were still open, as though he were waiting to see his disciples one last time. Only days ago, he had been wounded in a clash with a Magistrate of Yingtian. He should have been in bed, recovering — not lying here in rags, dead in the dirt. Yuming's temples throbbed. The pressure behind his eyes felt like it might split his skull.\n\nHe didn't know how it had come to this. He only knew that the thing ahead of him — writhing, its tentacles lashing — was to blame.\n\n\"Yuming...\"\nA dying Drifter clutched at the hem of his clothes, forcing out a final warning through failing breath.\n\"Don't go... that's... that's Buxia...\"\n\nTwo hours earlier, Yuming had been on the road to Haojing to fetch a Zesheng apothecary. Buxia had been complaining of pain again. The apothecary took one look at the signs at the foot of the mountain, went pale, and made his excuses at once. As a last courtesy, he left Yuming with a warning about Deterioration.\n\nEven with that warning, Yuming couldn't bring himself to believe it. He couldn't square the cheeky, ever-laughing girl with what stood in front of him now: a horrifying, bloodstained monster that had already taken more than a dozen lives.\n\nWhat had happened was clear enough. <H>Something</> monstrous had awakened inside Buxia. <H>It</> had gone after the defenceless: the old, the weak, women and children. His shifu, trying to protect them, had been forced to fight, and had died here. The only thing Yuming couldn't account for was Kezhou. Where was he? And then, in spite of everything, a flicker of relief rose in his chest. Thank goodness Kezhou wasn't here.\n\nThe creature had nothing human left of it. And yet it kept forcing out the same broken words, again and again, from what passed for a mouth.\n\"Yuming... Shixiong... help me...\"\nYuming's stomach lurched. Only then did he realise how much he had been breathing in the motes without noticing. The spores were already taking hold, draining his strength with every second.\nHe had heard those words from Buxia countless times. Sometimes she tossed them out with a cheeky grin. Sometimes they were flustered when she'd been caught skiving and wanted him to smooth things over. Sometimes she whined them like a spoiled brat. And sometimes, more recently, they were real: her hearing worsening again, asking him to bring back an apothecary. Most of the time, he hadn't taken her cries for help seriously. Now came the price. This was his sin. His punishment. And now, even if it was already too late, he moved.\n\nBefore the spores could numb his limbs completely, he lifted his spear, slow but unwavering, and drove it into the creature. It wailed, but did not try to dodge. He leaned his weight into the shaft and twisted the head, forcing it deeper. The thing convulsed at once, writhing hard enough to wrench at his arms. Barbed tendrils raked his skin again and again. A shriek tore through the air, sharp enough to make his ears ring. Spores poured from its mouthparts in a torrent, throwing up a red haze so thick it blurred the world.\n\nIn that moment, Yuming's mind went blank. He didn't even try to cover his mouth and nose. He drove the spear on, bracing it against the rock face with everything he had left. For a while he was sure he was losing. His arms felt fused to the shaft. He couldn't tell how long it went on — minutes, perhaps, or longer than he could measure. Then the resistance along the spear began to ebb. At last, the creature stopped struggling. Yuming let out a breath he hadn't realised he was holding. Only then did he understand that he had forgotten how to let go. The skin at the base of his fingers had split under the strain, and sweat soaked the shaft, his palm clinging stubbornly to the wood.\n\nHe stared at the thin stream pooling around his feet. The sun was almost gone now. Only then could he see it for what it was.\nIt was blood. Blood spilt from the bodies of those who were once at his side.\n\nFrom that day on, scenes like this returned to him again and again. A nightmare he would never be rid of.",

For someone who remembers every detail about every legionary — family backgrounds, areas of expertise, salaries and mortgage payments, to name a few — there seem to be two apparent explanations for this: laziness and disinterest.\nHowever, upon closer discussion, you'd realise that it's neither — he simply doesn't understand the whole thing.\nMemorising an oath isn't like assembling a machine where you follow a step-by-step process, nor is it like piecing together clues or drawing up a detailed plan — it's more about faith and passion. It's not that Randy is emotionally tone-deaf — he simply can't fathom the fervour and fanaticism soldiers feel for that kind of devotion. It baffles him, much like how he never understood why his father would reduce himself to a mindless instrument of war just for an abstract notion of honour propagated in the oath, ultimately paying the price with his life, left in a vegetative state.​",

I'm still so hungry...\"\nClutching her rumbling stomach, she picked up a dry twig and began to sketch in the shallow snow the foods her nose teased her with — roast chicken, doughnuts, and... the simplest of all, bread.\n\"I'd love some bread...\" Truffle mused, tracing the bread more vividly in the snow, believing that the more lifelike her drawing is, the stronger the scent would become — yes, it smelled so real, as if it were right in front of her.\nSuddenly, Truffle looked up and saw a loaf of bread floating in the air, just as she had imagined. Reaching out to grab it, she noticed it was being held by a small creature.\nIt was a tiny, pink animal, dusted with snow like a sugar-coated strawberry cake. Though it was shivering from the cold, it didn't seem afraid of the girl. Instead, it lifted its head, raising the bread higher, trying to bring it closer to Truffle's hand.\nTruffle hesitantly took the bread and then saw the tiny creature clearly. It was struggling to stay upright on its hind legs, staring intently at her, obviously urging her to eat the bread quickly.\nAs the nursery rhyme continued to drift from the room above, that frosty night witnessed the first, and perhaps the most profound miracle in Truffle's life. And for the creature that would later be named Filbert, it might have been just as miraculous.",

Sometimes, they'd be spotted helping out in restaurant kitchens; other times, you'd see them foraging under an oak tree for anything to quell their hunger.\nThe task of naming her pig friend baffled Truffle for a long time, until the day she lost her first baby tooth while trying to crack open a tough filbert.\nShe'd heard from the elders that losing a tooth was a sign of growing up. Truffle yearned to grow up, because growing up meant becoming strong enough to provide for herself. Hence, the symbolic filbert inspired the name for her one and only friend — Filbert.\nBut their separation came much sooner than Truffle had imagined. One day, while gathering mushrooms on a rocky cliff, Truffle slipped and fell. When she opened her eyes again, she found herself lying on a soft, warm bed, candles flickering high above, fresh air filling her lungs instead of the usual scent of earth — she was in a small room in the Elysian Church's sanctuary. It was Priestess McGuffin who had found her unconscious at the foot of the cliff and brought her here.\nA comfortable bed, clean bandages, fresh water, and clean food — these were luxuries that had only existed in Truffle's dreams. She lay there, overwhelmed, fearing it would all vanish if she pinched herself.\nThe kind-hearted priests and priestesses asked Truffle about her home and family, intending to send her home once she recovered.\n\"I... I don't have any family. But I have a friend named Filbert, she's waiting for me out there.\"\n\"Filbert... that's not a common name.\"\n\"Uh-huh, and she's a very good pig.\"\n\"A pig!?\" The priests and priestesses exchanged hesitant looks. \"We cannot keep large pets in the sanctuary.\"\n\"But Filbert isn't a pet! She's my friend!\"\nBefore she could argue further, Priestess McGuffin interjected, \"Don't waste time, Truffle. You have to choose between staying here and staying with your pig.\"\nTruffle thought of that distant winter night when she huddled against a thick wall, overhearing the nursery rhyme sung by children snug in their home with their family.\nTruffle didn't have much time to decide. She thought of the soft bed and the piles of bread in the little room, and finally, she took the priestess's hand. The orange-scented glow of the setting sun blurred her vision.\nIt seemed Truffle had finally found a warm home, and all the memories of her wandering days soon sank into darkness, like the sun disappearing beyond the horizon.\nYet, in the dead of night, while everyone else was asleep, Truffle quietly slipped out of that warm house and made her way towards a place she could barely remember. Surrounded by towering buildings and the eerie calls of unknown birds, Truffle began to feel uneasy. Still, she pressed on, despite the lingering pain from her injuries. She knew she had to go to that place... As long as she could make it there...\nAlmost there... She could already see the giant window from that winter night. No melodies or enticing aromas drifted out this time, so she couldn't be sure if it was the right place — until she saw that familiar figure, only much larger now.\nIn a scene as poetic as any playwright could depict, in the stillness of the night, Truffle ran forward and flung herself at the massive figure.\n\"Filbert!\"\nAs the first rays of dawn lit the horizon, tears glistened on Truffle's cheeks.",

Truffle, her own belly just as empty, would drag herself over to comfort them.\n"It\'s okay, just try to sleep. You won\'t feel the hunger if you\'re asleep."\n"But I\'m too hungry to fall asleep... Aren\'t you hungry?"\nTruffle patted her own flat stomach, her brows furrowing in frustration as she exhaled a sigh.\n"I\'m starving, actually. But don\'t worry — I know a trick to help us fall asleep. Just close your eyes."\nTruffle placed her warm little hands over her friend\'s eyes and began to whisper a silly, makeshift lullaby, one she invented on the spot: "Imagine a huge wheat field, and you\'re a little mole. In your tunnel, there are tons of potatoes! You count them: one potato, two potatoes, three potatoes, four potatoes..."\n"Twenty-seven potatoes, twenty-eight potatoes, twenty-nine potatoes..."\n"Fifty-three potatoes... fifty-four potatoes... fifty-six... fifty-seven... *snores*..."\nAs the rumblings subsided, Truffle\'s own stomach played the final note.\nLying in the darkness, Truffle thought back to her days of wandering with Filbert.

        text: 'On that hunger-clouded night, Truffle made up her mind that she would try her best to end the symphony of rumbling stomachs.\nThe next day, to everyone\'s surprise, she walked out of the Church\'s house and headed straight for the forest, whistling as she went. Normally, Truffle only dared to sneak out at night to play with her companion, careful not to stray too far or cause any trouble that might attract the stern gaze of Priestess McGuffin. But today was different — Truffle had a grand plan brewing in her little head.\nAs expected, the clip-clop of hooves soon joined her whistling — it was her dear friend, Filbert. Unaffected by the famine, Filbert was as plump as ever, perhaps even larger than Truffle remembered.\n"Filbert, do you remember our days of wandering together?"\nTruffle reminisced about those times, recalling how Filbert had carried her, weak and weary, to many places: to a thawing river where they caught plenty of fish, to a barren forest where they found an abundance of nuts, and to the cliffs where they gathered lots of mushrooms. It was then that Truffle realised the vast bounty that lay beyond the city\'s reach.\nSo, if the city\'s running out of food, why not gather more from the wild?\nTruffle shared her big plan with Filbert, and the inseparable duo embarked on their quest.\nThey reached the riverbanks, only to find them lined with people desperately trying to catch fish, but with little success.\nThey ventured into the forest, but even the bark and leaves of the trees had been stripped for sustenance.\nThey decided to give up on the quest to the cliffs, knowing all too well what awaited them there...\nIt seemed as though the whole world was starving. Fish, bugs, birds, and beasts — every creature was desperately consuming others in a futile bid for survival, only to fall, starve, and rot in the end...\nExhausted, Truffle collapsed under a tree that had been gnawed nearly to pieces.\nThe cold, hunger-stricken blur of that snowy night returned. Truffle felt so cold and hungry... and Filbert\'s form began to fade before her eyes...\nBut just then, Filbert, who was also defeated and worn out, suddenly perked up as she caught a scent. She scampered to a nearby tree and began digging with what little strength she had left.\n...\nA sharp, pungent smell filled Truffle\'s nostrils, rousing her from the brink of unconsciousness. There, just like before, Filbert was offering her something to eat.\nWith her considerable expertise in food, Truffle instantly recognised it was a Rubycap, a rare edible mushroom growing deep beneath the earth under trees. Due to their elusive nature and the effort required to unearth them, no one had yet attempted to harvest them.\nThough it tasted strange, as Truffle chewed the Rubycap, she felt her strength returning. Meanwhile, Filbert had already unearthed a dozen more under the tree.\nAs they hustled back and forth, the priestesses at the Church were astounded to find heaps of Rubycaps stacked high at their doorstep. They quickly ate their fill and began distributing the surplus to the famished townsfolk.\nBy the time green buds sprouted anew in the forest, the famine had subsided. Yet Truffle felt a twinge of sadness — she realised that with everyone now fed, there was no longer a need for her and Filbert to forage together, which meant she wouldn\'t be able to spend as much time with Filbert.\nFeeling downcast, Truffle wanted to ask Priestess McGuffin for her permission to play with Filbert for a few more days, but she didn\'t have the courage to voice her thoughts and ended up pacing back and forth outside the Church until she accidentally bumped into Priestess McGuffin, who was returning from town.\n"I... um... about Filbert, er..." Truffle fumbled for words, trying to articulate her small wish to the typically unsmiling priestess. To her surprise, Priestess McGuffin smiled, handing her a letter. Truffle read the letter, struggling to understand the fancy script:\n"Beneath the sacred branches of the Heaventree... by the grace of the Great Nine... Truffle, child of this land... um, something something in times of need… the noble creature known as Filbert... who something at her side... Truffle is hereby bestowed the title Comm-something... Filbert... the Special Comm-something..."\n"I don\'t understand, Priestess McGuffin. What does this letter mean? It also says something about Filbert... oh, about her... can you please not send Filbert away? She really helped a lot... can you let her stay a little longer?"\nPriestess McGuffin kept smiling as she knelt down to Truffle\'s level and said, "The letter says that you and Filbert can stay together forever."\n"Really!?" Truffle\'s eyes widened in disbelief. "Thank you, gods! Thank you, Priestess McGuffin!"\n"No, Truffle, it\'s us who should be thanking you and Filbert. You two are the greatest miracle I\'ve ever seen."\n\nThough still not fully grasping the priestess\'s words, Truffle beamed with joy, for everything she had wished for had come true.',

The excitement had her wide-eyed all night.\nClasping her father's hand on one side and her mother's on the other, Psyche stepped into the flower shop. It was a fleeting summer, bright sunlight slanting through the windows with butterfly decorations, laying delicate butterfly-shaped shadows upon the petals, as if real butterflies had alighted among the blooms. Having imitated her parents in watering the last pot, Psyche, who had been up all night, was finally a little tired.\nSix-year-old Psyche nodded off on the balcony, lost in a cosy dream. In the dream, the gentle sun thawed Icelake's eternally frostbound earth, awakening a field of vibrant wildflowers. Amidst this floral tapestry, vivid butterflies flitted with grace. With arms outstretched, Psyche chased the beckoning sunlight and, alongside the butterflies, took to the whims of a mischievous breeze, gliding with abandon in the embrace of the sky.\n\n\"Psyche, time to get up.\"\nTwelve-year-old Psyche climbed out of bed. It was still dark outside, but she knew it was time to help out in the shop.\nSleeves rolled up, she accompanied her father to the deep well a kilometre away to fetch water. Returning to the shop with the morning dew still fresh, just as the horizon began to brighten, her mother had already boiled the water. Without even a moment to soothe their sore arms, Psyche and her father mixed the hot and cold water to just the perfect temperature before filling the watering cans — Icelake's well water was too cold for the delicate flowers, so they had to make sure their roots weren't harmed by the chill. After tending to the last pot of flowers and placing it on the plant stand, Psyche watched her parents open the shop windows and start another day of business before she waved goodbye and set off for school.\nAt twelve, Psyche understood why her parents did not want to teach her about flowers when she was younger — it wasn't a hobby or pastime for them, but a means of livelihood. Still, she loved those flowers. The opening buds would always put a smile on her face despite the cold and tiredness.\n\n\"Psyche, time to get up.\"\nSeventeen-year-old Psyche slowly sat up in bed.

Following such warnings, her newly made friends would be whisked away by them, never to appear again.\nYet, there was once an exception — a Sola girl her own age, whom Psyche chanced upon at the flower shop. That girl, brimming with curiosity about Psyche, would often ignore her servant\'s warnings and dash into the flower shop to find Psyche and play with her. She even invited Psyche to her grand mansion to play with her exquisite toy blocks together.\n"See, this little one is me, and the one with horns, that\'s you..." she said with excitement while arranging the blocks, "and they\'re playing together..."\n"Don\'t you find my horns scary?" Psyche asked timidly.\n"Not at all, I think they are pretty!" the girl replied without hesitation, "Oh, right! Let\'s decorate your horns with some cute accessories!"\nSpringing to her feet, she ran to the accessory cabinet and started to carefully go through a variety of ribbons and hair accessories: "Hmm... this red one is cute, but it doesn\'t quite match your dress. What about this golden one...?"\nAs she stood, her dress billowed, knocking over the horned figurine. Psyche noticed this, and she gently righted it to stand beside its little friend, then smiled.\n"Psyche, which one do you like?" the girl rushed back, thrusting a heap of colourful accessories into Psyche\'s arms, "You can take anything you like!"\n"I—"\nPsyche\'s words were interrupted by the creak of the door. The girl\'s mother — a well-dressed lady — entered the room, her face a mix of anger and disgust, as if she saw not a little girl in Psyche, but a dirty mongrel. What followed were the usual rebukes and curses that Psyche had grown accustomed to. As Psyche was driven out of the mansion, she heard the girl crying, "Psyche, I\'m sorry...! I\'ll go to your place and we can play together again!"\nBut from that day on, the girl was grounded by her parents, even the windows of her room were locked and covered with opaque paper.\nPsyche knew it would end up this way, but she still felt that she owed it to the girl\'s kindness to at least tell her "I would cherish anything you give me".\nThese words lingered in Psyche\'s heart for many years until one day, she accidentally bumped into a lavishly dressed Sola boy on the street. Before she could apologise, a girl, also in fine clothes, pulled the boy away, "How many times have I told you to stay away from those horned people! And you, you dirty Charon, are you blind? How dare you push my little broth—"\nThe scolding abruptly ceased. The girl\'s gaze fixed on Psyche\'s horns, and her accusing finger awkwardly froze mid-air. Psyche recognised the girl — it was her wealthy little friend from the past, whom she had always felt beholden to.\n"Psyche...? You..." the girl was flustered, "I..."\n"You\'ve mistaken me for someone else, miss," Psyche offered an apologetic smile, "I\'m terribly sorry, I was a bit dizzy just now and didn\'t see your little brother."\nPsyche turned away and left. Those words she kept in her heart for years were ultimately discarded into the bin of time, just like those accessories and toy blocks she once touched.',

        text: '"I\'ll ask you one last time, Psyche. Are you sure this is what you want?"\nPsyche nodded firmly. She heard Henrik let out a long, heavy sigh. By now, her vision had blurred completely. Unable to see his face, she pieced together his image from memory.\nIn Psyche\'s earliest recollections of Dr Henrik, he was always sombre and distant, carrying a burden that seemed far too heavy for a man of his age, as if an old soul resided in a body still in its prime. Only when he glanced at the photograph on his desk did a flicker of genuine emotion briefly surface. Psyche had her suspicions about who the girl in the picture might be, but she never asked — she didn\'t want to pry into the grief he might have been hiding. Instead, she quietly placed a fresh flower in the vase on his desk each day.\nHenrik remained a man of few words, his life a steady repetition of simple, monotonous routines. Yet over time, Psyche noticed a subtle change — a spark seemed to grow in his eyes, like a sprout pushing through charred wood.\nOne day, Henrik unlocked an old bookcase. Years of dust billowed into the air, causing Psyche to shield her eyes. Peeking through her fingers, she saw Henrik coughing as he sifted through piles of old papers and notes, muttering words like "blockade response" and "Crystallo of Stella." Although the technical jargon was lost on her, she vividly remembered his final whispered words:\n"Hayley, I want to try it again... Do you think it could be a different story this time?"\nFrom that day, Henrik locked himself in his office, working around the clock with phials, petri dishes, and all manner of colourful liquids. Psyche didn\'t interfere; she had never seen him so passionately pursue anything. Before, he had seemed like a distant, benevolent deity, merely decreeing the merciful end to suffering at the appropriate moments. Now, he was more like a man grasping desperately at hope, or a child chasing after a long-lost treasure. \nFor the first time, Henrik seemed thoroughly human.\n\n...\n\n"Then drink this."\nHenrik\'s voice snapped Psyche back to reality. Something cold was pressed into her hand. Tracing its shape, she felt the rough surface of a small phial. As she cradled it, feeling its slight weight, she understood the life-changing significance it carried. This phial was the culmination of Henrik\'s relentless work, the product of countless sleepless nights. If fortune smiled upon her, this phial could free her from a hopeless fate. And if not... well, at least she would have helped Henrik refine his research and contributed to saving more lives, wouldn\'t she?\nShe couldn\'t help but picture the liquid inside — crafted from Crystallo of Stella, it must shimmer with a faint, ethereal glow. The thought brought a smile to her lips.\n"{nickname} and I retrieved that piece of Crystallo of Stella together. I trust it will bring me good luck," she mused, hopeful.',

Others, like Sibylle Mason, have earned their place through sheer military prowess — wielding influence not only on the battlefield but also within the Empire's political landscape.\nSibylle's meteoric rise from an ordinary legion chief to her current exalted position is mostly a result of her exceptional military achievements. Her combat strategies are more agile and inventive than those of any chief the Empire has seen before.\nAccording to the Empire's time-honoured traditions, a soldier's greatest glory is earned in direct confrontation: troops march forward with unwavering courage and iron discipline, undaunted even as they close in on the enemy. Chiefs, however, are expected to oversee the battlefield with a sharp, predatory gaze, bearing the burden of the rising death toll, waiting for the perfect moment to make a decisive move — a bloody gamble where soldiers' lives are the stakes and fate itself is the dealer.\nGlory, pure and undeniable, is the dream of every chief — a single, monumental victory that would immortalize their name. To have a warship, a street, or even a city bear your name was the ultimate prize.\nBut in the face of the rebellion by The Forsakens, such lofty aspirations became little more than a pipe dream. These insurgents, relying on \"Daimons\" as their main force, rarely engaged the Legion head-on. Instead, they used magic and superior mobility to wage guerrilla warfare, striking from the shadows with hit-and-run attacks. They even weaponized Filthoids to devastating effect. The Legion's traditional combat methods proved futile, and those chiefs who clung to their notions of glory were left swallowing the bitter draught of defeat.\nSibylle, however, was not one of them. Born on the streets, with deep knowledge of alchemy and Charon magic, she knew exactly how to counter these elusive foes.\nShe requisitioned as much grain as possible, starving the rebels of their supplies.\nShe sent Charon citizens as false defectors, infiltrating The Forsakens and poisoning their rations before ordering surprise attacks.\nShe staged strategic retreats, leaving behind booby-trapped supplies, spreading terror throughout enemy ranks.\nShe offered noble titles to enemy leaders in exchange for their allegiance, only to slaughter them all once victory was assured.\n...\nThis is how Sibylle claimed victory after victory, battlefield after battlefield. Her Charon heritage never hindered her rise.\nThough her methods were often criticized as dishonourable — \"What else would you expect from someone of such lowly birth?\" her detractors sneered — none could deny the truth: Sibylle is the Empire's most reliable legion chief. She casts aside mercy, ethics, and even honour — values others hold dearer than life itself — and she always wins.\nNow, who would dare to make an enemy of Chief Sibylle?",

Startled, Sibylle found the bird injured, its teary eyes gazing up at her. Her kind heart led her to take it in. She bandaged its wounds, fed it, and cared for it as best she could. As its wounds slowly healed, the raven began to peck gently at her palm, then to walk, and eventually, to fly — awkwardly at first, but still, it flew. Seeing its recovery filled Sibylle with genuine joy. \"Even the ugliest of ravens,\" she thought, \"even one that's fallen into the mud, can one day soar in the skies again.\"\nOne evening, a group of street children, about Sibylle's age, knocked on her door, begging for food. Like the raven, they were teary-eyed. With the same kindness she had shown the bird, Sibylle shared her modest meal of bread and water with them. However, once fed, they didn't leave. Instead, they forced their way into her home, taking what little food she had left and even her parents' keepsakes. Sibylle tried to fight back, but the children overpowered her, dragging her down and beating her until she was covered in bruises.\nSensing the danger, the raven flapped its wings and attacked the intruders, pecking at their heads in a desperate attempt to defend its home. But the bird, still recovering, wasn't strong enough. The ringleader grabbed it tightly, sneering, \"A feisty little thing, aren't you?\"\n\"Please, let her go!\" Sibylle's voice cracked with desperation. \"Take everything you want, just don't hurt her!\"\nHer frantic pleas fell on deaf ears. Pinned to the ground by two stronger kids, her tears mingled with the dirt as she watched in horror.\nThrough bloodshot eyes, she saw the raven slammed into the ground, followed by the sickening crunch of boots crushing its fragile body.\nWhen the intruders finally left, Sibylle, battered and bruised, crawled over to the raven. Cradling its lifeless body in her arms, she kissed its cold feathers. She could not tell how much blood it had lost — the bird's jet-black plumage hid the stains. A tiny life had slipped away into the shadows, its death as silent as its suffering.\n\nYears later, as a graduate of the Spathatoi Alchademy and a rising star in the Legion, Sibylle returned to that shack. She thought she heard the flutter of raven's wings, but perhaps it was just a trick of memory — the house was empty, save for the echo of her footsteps. Distant memories flooded back. That night, she had wailed miserably, mourning both the loss of a fragile life and her own helplessness. It was the last time she ever cried. The darkness had swallowed her tears, and no one had heard the sobs of that powerless eight-year-old girl.",

As they neared a large boulder, the girl suddenly threw out her arm, halting Flamel. The still night air was suddenly split by the crackling sound of electric arcs across the space before them.\n"The Claw Flower just retracted into the ground. If we had kept going, it would\'ve killed us. But don\'t worry — it\'s stunned now. You can proceed with your investigation," the girl said, calm despite the sheen of sweat on her forehead. The effort had clearly taken a toll on her.\n"Thank you," Flamel said, retrieving tools from her backpack. "Since you\'ve read the book, you know that the author\'s discovery of Helix proved all Charons share origins with Filthoids," she continued as she expertly dissected the Filthoid, storing its tissues in vials. "Doesn\'t that frighten you? It\'s not just the Deteriorators — every Charon has Filthoid blood flowing through their veins. Including you."\n"There\'s nothing to be afraid of. I don\'t care about what I was. I care about what I\'ll become," the girl replied, her violet eyes gleaming with determination. "Besides, you can only master your power once you understand it."\n"I\'m finished," Flamel said, packing her tools. "Thank you, this is a rare sub-species of Physalis Filthoid. Now, can you escort me to the nearest town?" She paused. "What\'s your name?"\n"Sibylle Mason," the girl replied.\n"Very well, Sibylle Mason," Flamel smiled, her coat flapping in the valley\'s night wind. "I have an address for you. If you\'re interested in Filthoids and the power of the Daimons, come to this residence and say your name. I\'ll be waiting."\n\n"Blasted traitor!

A deft twist, and a snap filled the air — the unmistakable sound of a jaw breaking. One by one, she stuffed the gold coins into their mouths, their curses turning to muffled gurgles.\n"Morons. This is where your pathetic lives end. Mine is just beginning."\nClutching the scrap of paper Flamel had torn from her notebook, Sibylle turned and began her journey back to Dismania.',

It's an expanse of flame that surges toward you no matter how desperately you try to escape, engulfing everything. Scalding air seeps into your nostrils — viscous, oppressive — while it crackles and roars around your ears.\n Above this fiery sea, any bird brave enough to soar becomes a blind raven, plummeting into scorched earth, stirring ripples of flame.\n \nThe operation was meant to be highly classified. The commander had run through countless scenarios before departure — yet no one truly grasped the defensive might at the heart of the enemy stronghold.\nAfter three days and nights of contemplation, the commander decided to roll the dice. A small but elite team would be deployed via the Empire's newest airships, aiming for a swift, decisive strike at the enemy's core — to \"decapitate\" their force.\nIt seemed a desperate gamble — but also their best shot at victory. Thirteen Daimons, clad in the same uniforms as ordinary soldiers, were quietly dispatched without farewell or ceremony — sent off as plainly as one might deliver rations to the front, on what might well have been a one-way mission.\nThough mentally prepared for the worst, it wasn't until they stood beneath the gaze of the divine that they truly understood the terror of facing the gods.\n \nBeams of searing light tore through the night, burning as they streaked across the sky like eternal fire, devouring everything in their path.\nAt that moment, Sibylle stood at the edge of the inferno. The most she could make out beyond the blaze were charred branches, or the remains of what might once have been wildlife — though she no longer had the strength to tell them apart.\nSibylle was fortunate not to be part of the strike team — she had been held back as their last resort. If all went according to plan, once the others reached the tower's heart and completed their task, she would spirit them away under cover of shadows, before the enemy ever took notice. And if the mission failed, she would carry off as many of the wounded as she could, to lessen the toll.\nShe didn't know what her comrades had faced deep within the tower — but the hellish scene before her could only be the worst of all their countless reckonings.\nOf the twelve who had entered, only three emerged. Behind them, a dreadful light pursued relentlessly: wherever it fell, flames erupted — even stone was pierced through. Yet that radiance was no knight's weapon; it was as though the gods themselves had cast down divine punishment.\nTwo comrades thrust the unconscious, grievously wounded commander into Sibylle's care, then dragged their battered bodies toward the distance — choosing to stay behind and cover the rear.\n \nThanks to the Daimons' resilient constitution, the two could still — barely — draw their swords to support themselves.\nAs the flames around them subsided, their laboured breathing eased slightly, and they no longer spat hot blood with every breath.\nBut as the fire faded, a battalion of heavily armed knights appeared. Their footsteps alone, echoing across the battlefield, spoke of their elite status — soldiers sent not to take prisoners, but to eradicate every intruder.\nOrdinarily, Daimons could scatter foes like rabbits before a hound — but incapacitated, they were helpless prey.\nGunfire tore through the air, ripping apart the already feeble arcs of their blades and tearing through their bodies.\nInitially hesitant, the Elysian knights advanced, growing bolder with each step. Within moments, they were close enough to drive their blades into the spines of the wounded Daimons.\n \nWatching the brutal scene unfold, Sibylle felt a surreal detachment. These were her comrades — soldiers who had trained alongside her mere days before. Now they stood at death's door, as she watched from afar.\nWith the last of their strength, they leaned on each other for support, their bodies swaying, their gaze turning — perhaps by chance, perhaps by will — toward Sibylle's airship.\nSibylle's rational mind, honed by years of discipline, told her to obey orders — to let her comrades die. But deep within, a faint voice desperately protested.\nThey had never treated her poorly. Like her, they were fiercely loyal to the Empire, determined to earn glory, each burdened by their own troubled pasts. Many nights had passed in the dim barracks, filled with stories of the past and dreams of the future. For someone who claimed to have no friends, they had come the closest.\nAnd now, these almost-friends stood before her, gazing at her as they faced death.\nBut what did their gaze mean? A plea for help? Doubt? Resentment? Or something else entirely?\n \nSibylle knew she should ignore these thoughts. She had to follow orders without question — to snuff out the last remnants of emotion within her, emotions that shouldn't have existed in the first place.\nBut... could she? Could she stand by and let her comrades — her almost-friends — die?\nIn a futile attempt to escape the weight of her decision, she closed her eyes, hoping the nightmare would disappear.\nBut in that very moment, her comrades made the decision for her. They drew their daggers and, with grim determination, plunged them into each other's throats. No hesitation. No second thoughts. As if they had made this choice long ago. Smiling, they fell. At that same moment, Sibylle set the airship's engines to life.\n \nAmidst the roar of the machinery, she let out the breath she had held for so long. Blinking, she found a tear upon her cheek — a tear no one had ever seen from her. She did not know what it meant, just as she did not know what their final gaze had meant.\nPerhaps it was relief — that she hadn't needed to wrestle with breaking her orders. Or perhaps... it was something else entirely.\n \n...\nFor setting foot upon the tower of the gods, the Empire declared the mission a victory. In the official obituary, it was written: of the thirteen who had gone, only Sibylle returned.\nShe was soon elevated to Legion Chief, and ever after she would call the operation her \"Survival from Hell.\"",

        text: 'Several ravens perched on the windowsill, preening their glossy black feathers. Flamel couldn\'t help but recall their other moniker — harbingers of death. Signalling misfortune had always seemed the raven\'s grim duty.\nDue to the secretive nature of the research at the Alchemy Academy, the institution\'s rooms rarely had windows. Instead, they were illuminated by constant, artificial light, like the pallid, perpetual sun of a land in eternal twilight. Yet Flamel had stubbornly insisted on having a window in her office. Perhaps it gave her a fragile sense of connection to the outside world.\nToday, however, the narrow window was overtaken by dark-feathered visitors.\nSitting upright at her desk, her hair meticulously coiled into a bun at the nape of her neck, Flamel ignored the knocking at the door. Her calm gaze remained fixed on the window, not sparing a glance for her visitor — her former student, the legion chief, Sibylle Mason.\n\n"Ms Maxima Flamel," Sibylle\'s voice broke the awkward silence, "I am here to formally notify you: due to actions considered an indirect betrayal of the Empire, your positions at the Spathatoi Alchademy, including your title as Chief Alchemist, are hereby revoked." Sibylle looked at her former mentor, speaking in a measured tone as she delivered the pardon she had painstakingly secured, having sacrificed her pride in the process. "In light of your past contributions to the Empire, you will not be incarcerated in the Royal Military Prison. Should you choose to continue your research, you may retain a laboratory here, albeit under strict surveillance."\nFlamel remained silent. After a long, tense pause, she sighed deeply and finally turned to face her interlocutor.\n"Is that all you have come to say, Chief Sibylle?"\nSibylle averted her gaze, refusing to meet her mentor\'s eyes. "Yes, that is all."\n"The first time I met you, you were just a child. I was already your prisoner back then, much like today." Flamel\'s tone was calm. "The kidnapping — it was orchestrated by you from the start, wasn\'t it?"\nSibylle shook her head. "There\'s no point in dwelling on the past, Ms Flamel. What matters is the present."\n"The Alchademy was meant to be a sanctuary for the pursuit of knowledge, but you and Julius have turned it into a disgrace for the Empire." The ageing scholar met her former student\'s gaze, making one last, futile attempt to evoke some semblance of regret. "Knowledge exists to make the world a better place. Yet you—"\n"I treat knowledge as a mere stepping stone to power," Sibylle interrupted, finishing the sentence for her. "Yes, I remember your words. Your ideals are noble, and my pursuit of knowledge is disgraceful — I\'ve never denied that. But has it ever occurred to you that having such lofty ideals is a luxury afforded only to those born into privilege, like you? Your life has always been filled with options and safety nets. But for the ravens on that windowsill? There are only two possibilities — to fly with all their might or be shot down by a child\'s slingshot."\nSibylle continued. "And there\'s another thing you don\'t understand — ravens, too, have their ambitions. Once they fly high enough, they can see things that creatures tethered to the ground never will. And with that, they can do things no one else can — things that might truly change the world."\n"Chief… no — Sibylle, tell me the truth!" Flamel suddenly stood, knocking her chair to the floor. The ravens fluttered in alarm, taking flight from the window.\n"That day, at the Tower of the Elysian Church — what did you see?"\n\nSibylle remained silent, the setting sun slanting through the window, casting a glow on her face. For a brief moment, Flamel thought she saw something akin to divine grace in her student\'s expression — like a serene icon carved by Elysian artisans.\n"Nothing, Ms Flamel," she finally spoke. "Let\'s return to the matter at hand. If you wish to stay and continue your research here, just sign this agreement. You have three days to decide."\nWithout waiting for a response, Sibylle turned and walked away. She strode down the long, dimly lit corridors, never once looking back. Only when she was well out of sight, far removed from the office, did she pause. She turned around and bowed deeply towards the room.\n"Farewell, Ms Flamel."',

Actually, to describe it merely as \"unfriendly\" would be an understatement — the voice not only routinely berated him as a \"knock-off\" but also interspersed its harangues with cruel and jarring curses, as if Yale had committed unforgivable sins that even the Misty Sea could not cleanse. Frustrated and feeling wronged by the baseless accusations, Yale often tried to retort. But hampered by his stutter, he would only manage to stammer an ineffectual \"Y—Y—You...\" This, unsurprisingly, only fueled more ruthless mockery from Oliver.\nYet what truly intensified the hostility between them was Mr Jones's reaction when he discovered the existence of this voice. The normally stern man would descend into an unusual frenzy, clutching at Yale's delicate shoulders, his fingers trembling as they dug painfully into the boy's flesh.\n\"You've heard his voice, haven't you!? Tell me you heard it! You must not lose to him, my dear boy, my precious creation. You need to control it, conquer it, and kill it! Do you hear me? Answer me! Now!!!\"\nMr Jones's face twisted with obsession, his forehead pressing against Yale's, spittle flying onto the boy's face. It was a profoundly unsettling experience. Only later, when the assistant researcher explained different emotions to Yale, did he vaguely understand that what he felt was fear — a deep, pervasive fear. Confused, Yale couldn't fathom why Mr Jones reacted so violently and eventually attributed it to the strange voice in his head.\nTheir strained relationship persisted for a long time, until one day, the assistant researcher brought a record player into Yale's room.The record player brought a touch of colour into Yale's otherwise black-and-white world, and for that, he cherished it deeply. Every night, he would look forward to discovering which record would be placed in the machine and what melodies would emerge to fill the room. Conversely, Oliver harboured a strong dislike for the record player, or more precisely, for the persistent static noise it emitted — a noise that made him even more agitated and uneasy. Realising this, a strange thought crossed Yale's mind — perhaps the voice in his head feared that static noise. Yale understood what it felt like to fear something — it was a terrible feeling that made one want to desperately run away. So, the next time the assistant researcher came with a new record, Yale stopped her from playing it.\n\"Don't you like this record anymore?\"\n\"I do, I really do, but I... I just don't want to hear it anymore.\"\nIncapable of lying, Yale couldn't explain his abrupt change of heart to the assistant researcher. Ultimately, she acquiesced and took the record away.\nThat night, Yale found it harder to drift off to sleep without the calming influence of music. Half-asleep, he heard a strange yet familiar humming. The sound was soft and melodious, like a gentle, soothing lullaby for a newborn baby.",

He couldn\'t understand why they felt the need to bind him so tightly — he had no intention of resisting.\nThe floor was littered with dozens of documents stamped "Confidential" in bold red. When Researcher Jones noticed that Yale had read these documents, his demeanour once again turned frenzied. He roughly secured the young boy to the operating table and administered an experimental catalyst that wasn\'t scheduled for use until several months later in the final stage of the experiment.\n"You naughty rascal, you\'ve seen what you shouldn\'t have — now I want you to kill him! Do it!"\nA sensation akin to magma flowing through his veins overwhelmed Yale, triggering an excruciating pain that elicited a piercing scream from the usually soft-spoken boy.\n\n"Oi, knock-off."\nThe familiar yet foreign voice intruded into his thoughts. Yale abruptly opened his eyes, not to the sight of the operating table, but to a gaze as calm as his own — it was another boy who looked exactly like him. Beneath them surged a sea of magma, as red as blood.\n"Who are you?"\nThe other did not respond but instead grasped Yale\'s throat decisively. His inhuman strength made it impossible for Yale to breathe, forcing him into a futile struggle for air. Only then did the owner of the hands speak, his tone slow and laden with contempt:\n"I\'m Oliver... the rightful owner of this body. You\'re just a knock-off version of me — don\'t play dumb, you already know all about it."\nYale gazed blankly into Oliver\'s eyes, recalling the confidential file titled "Controlled Alter Personality Experiment Log." The documents detailed the entire experimental procedure, filled with data on the dangerous preliminary personality tests, each page inscribed with the name "Oliver."\nOn the final page, Yale\'s name abruptly appeared, signifying the successful completion of the personality replacement experiment.\n"—Yale, I will make you my perfect creation."\nSo this was the true meaning of "creation." Precious memories of a happy childhood, life outside the lab, and a loving family — all of these were blank in Yale\'s mind, not due to forgetfulness, but because they had never existed.\nSo, who was he, really? He was Yale. And who was Yale? Oh, that\'s right — Yale was nothing more than a coward, a pitiful creature always obedient to the researcher\'s commands, an imperfect creation, and a parasite who stole a nest that wasn\'t his.\nOnly this time, Yale decided to help the poor little bird in that stolen nest. He let go of Oliver\'s hand, ready to surrender himself to the magma and embrace the fiery demise awaiting him.\nHowever, the anticipated suffocation did not follow. Instead, Yale was abruptly hoisted up. As Oliver\'s curses filled the air, it felt as though countless bombs were detonating around them, the intense ringing in his ears akin to bullets tearing through, churning his brain into chaos.\nAll the anger, the fear, the hatred — they erupted in that explosive moment, only to be silenced by a final, resounding boom.\nYale looked up at Oliver, whose expression remained as hostile as ever, yet Yale sensed that something had subtly shifted; though outwardly, everything appeared unchanged.\n"Hey, knock-off, there\'s actually a way for both of us to make it out alive. Are you in?"',

With every pause, tears silently slipped down his cheeks, tracing a miniature galaxy in the dark confines of the lab.\nJones seemed to be smiling, likely thinking Yale was crying over Oliver's death. He was convinced that this timid subject was, after all, an obedient child, a perfect creation that would never defy orders.\nOnly Yale knew the real reason for his tears. For the first time, he willingly embraced Jones — the once formidable man no longer seemed frightening at all.\n\"I've killed Oliver.\"\nYale's sobs grew more intense as he clung to Jones, crying uncontrollably in his arms. He even felt Jones gently pat his head, a rare gesture, almost like the father Yale had always wished for.\nYet, this was all inauthentic. Despite the warmth of Jones's touch, it came from a pair of hands that had orchestrated countless experiments that tormented him and Oliver and ruined their lives. It was time to bid farewell to these hands.\nYale pulled out the device he had been assembling every day — the one Oliver had dubbed the micro-bomb. All he had to do was press it against Jones, and in the ensuing chaos of the fire, he could escape to the vast world outside this white prison.\n\"Do it, Yale. It's okay if you want to cry for this man's death later.\"\nThe alchemy lab was ablaze, flames voraciously spreading, painting the night sky a vivid, grotesque red, erasing all traces of the sterile white.\nYale ran with every ounce of strength he had, his spirit soaring as he and Oliver alternated control of their body, gulping down the air outside that white prison. The air, thick with smoke, was acrid yet oddly sweet. Yale understood it was the scent of \"fire.\" No one could stop them now. They left Jones behind, left the lab behind, and left the Alchemy Academy behind.\nFinally, Yale collapsed, utterly spent, but the overwhelming sights around him kept his eyes wide open. The liberating breeze tempted him to struggle to his feet, even though he had no strength left.\nAs consciousness began to fade, Yale heard Oliver's voice once more, but this time it was calm, a tone he had never heard before.

Awkwardly, she apologised, "I\'m sorry for calling you that name.

Shortly thereafter, a woman named Camilla provided a long list of "dos & don\'ts and off-limit places within Icelake", which overwhelmed young Margie into drowsiness. When she was awakened by Camilla for the fourth time, she finally blurted her confusion out, "There weren\'t this many rules living on the snowfields! Is it more dangerous here than in the wild?"\nCamilla and her father fell into a long, silent pause. Just as Margie was about to doze off again, her father gently patted her head and murmured, "Sweetie, perhaps you\'re right."\n\nThe second time Margie stood at the gates of Icelake, she was leaving. The towering city she once marvelled at had transformed in her eyes — it now resembled a silent, hulking beast, its gates a gaping maw. The joy and excitement of her initial visit had dissipated, replaced by a mix of confusion and disillusionment.\nShe couldn\'t understand why being impervious to the cold and having horns was enough to make her a target of scorn. She didn\'t understand why sneaking into the "inner city" out of curiosity could warrant harsh punishment. Most terrifyingly, everyone else seemed to accept this as normal — even the Sola children would unhesitatingly throw stones at her, as if she were an outright monster. It was then that Margie realised, belatedly, that what she had thought was her haven had never truly welcomed her.\nPerhaps a child born of the snowfields is destined to return to the endless white.\nTurning back, fighting the tears that threatened to fall, she embarked on a solitary adventure.',

        text: 'Cold, perpetually cold.\nMargie didn\'t need to open her eyes to see the endless expanse of white stretching out before her once more, seemingly inescapable as the days and months passed — as if they were forever ensnared in its grasp.\nThe young Margie, still fuming over her disillusionment with Icelake, chose to trek deeper into the snowy wilderness, away from the city steeped in inequity. The deeper she ventured, the more her mind replayed scenes from her previous journey with her father—\n\nAs they first stepped onto the icy terrain, young Margie would ask her father daily, "Are we there yet?"\nEach time, Martin would respond with a number. Though young Margie lacked a tangible grasp of "distance," she understood that once the number dwindled to zero, their gruelling trek would conclude.\nBut the number didn\'t always diminish. When they got lost in the snow and ended up circling back to their previous campsite, the number went up. Injuries would also slow their progress, and when the harsh clime finally overcame Margie, rendering her too sick to stand, that number froze, just like everything else around them.\nDays of fever turned Margie into a small ember of heat in a vast, freezing wilderness. In her delirium, dreams of summer and sunlight had long since faded, replaced by the relentless cold. Yet, during her moments of lucidity, she still whispered the same question, her voice growing fainter each time: "Are we there yet?"\nBut there was no answer — only silence and her father\'s trembling hand, brushing gently over her burning forehead.\nDuring one particularly cold night, Margie dreamt of a star falling into her arms. Despite being dimmed by its descent, it still burned fiercely against her chill.\nThe next morning, as sunlight bathed her face, the fever had left her, and she felt surprisingly light and warm, almost as if she were still dreaming. Her father\'s crushing embrace and something warm and fluffy nestled in her arms confirmed the miracle — she had fully recovered.\nThe critter nestled in her arms would later become the inspiration for Plumpytail, the plush toy she would always carry with her. But back then, she was a scrawny little wildling, likely separated from her kin, her thin fur ill-equipped for the frost. Desperate for warmth, she had snuggled close to the only source of heat she could find — Margie\'s fevered body.\nIn the days that followed, their duo was joined by this little creature, cautious yet curious. She kept a watchful distance, only approaching when Margie laid out the best strips of jerky and stepped back. After vigorously sniffing the air, as if trying to make out all the odours, she would timidly snatch the offering...\n\nA piercing birdcall snapped Margie back to reality, reminding her that she now trod a path opposite to the one she had taken with her father. She sighed, trying to figure out the travel distance for a number to count again, but she had no idea where to begin.\nWhere was she supposed to go? Margie didn\'t know. Old Martin\'s homeland wasn\'t home, and neither was Icelake — so where did she belong? Was it this endless expanse of snow?\nThe snow continued to fall, like confetti from the nobles\' parades, settling softly on Margie\'s shoulders.\nShe lost track of time. The snow thickened, and her vision faded. She felt as if wrapped in a silvery blanket, the wind\'s lullaby coaxing her into the downy embrace of the snow beneath her.\nAmidst this familiar chill, Margie\'s dreams were unexpectedly vibrant. She dreamed of laughter and melodies, of people whose faces bore no trace of the hardship they knew too well. They called her "Princess," "Sweetie," or "Little Detective." She saw Camilla, Kennice, and the florist\'s daughter — everyone had healthy, rosy cheeks, untouched by the biting wind and snow.\nAnd at the very end, she saw Plumpytail — the little wildling she hadn\'t seen since leaving the snowfields. She had grown so much since then.\nNo, this was not a dream — Margie suddenly woke from her delirium. Plumpytail was real, because she appeared different from the little scrawny critter in her memories. She had become more nimble, hunting small creatures on the snowfields, even leaving a portion for Margie, who was still weak. Even the scraps she left behind after finishing a meal attracted plump birds, keeping them fed.\nMargie\'s heart eased. Plumpytail had found her way as a predator, able not only to feed herself but also to sustain the weaker creatures of the snowfields. Most importantly, she had found her own way of living.\n\nMargie remembered the dream she had, in which all the gaunt faces in the slums suddenly became healthy and cheerful. It was only a dream, but she suddenly realised what she had to do.\n"Old Martin! I\'m coming back!" she shouted into the wind, turning towards the direction from which she had come. "From today on, I\'m going to scour every rubbish bin in Icelake with you!"\n"Goodbye, Plumpytail!" she waved to the cat in the snow, then set off once more towards Icelake, a vast city filled with inequalities, but at the same time brimming with hopes and possibilities.',

The social elite buzzed with speculation about which lady of stature he would choose. Yet, against all expectations, he chose a widow with no means to her name.\nThe widow's family had once been among Icelake's oldest and most distinguished, but their glory had long since faded, leaving behind little more than a noble title. Worse still, her deceased husband had been branded a criminal for his adherence to the forbidden Elysian faith, and her daughter was a lowly Charon.\nThe gossip mills churned with theories about Glenville's unexpected choice of bride. Some romantics believed it was because the widow's beauty rivalled that of a leading opera diva; shrewd businessmen speculated she might possess a vast, secret fortune; and tabloid journalists claimed that Glenville, shunned by the snobbish old nobility for his humble roots, had strategically aligned himself with a fallen but aristocratic lineage. Meanwhile, those who favoured darker tales hinted at sorcery, claiming the widow's Charon daughter had ensnared the wealthy industrialist with dark magic to usurp his fortune.\nThe truth, however, remained shrouded in mystery. All that was known was that within two years of their marriage, the widow had given birth to Glenville's child.

The tree\'s branches formed our bodies, its leaves our hair, and its sap our souls. Every sentient creature in this world possesses a soul of equal worth."\nLittle Fina, with confusion clouding her young face, struggled with the concepts of "Solas," "Charons," and "souls" — words far too complex for a three-year-old to grasp. Sensing Fina\'s bewilderment, her mother gently stroked her hair and picked up a storybook from the shelf. She sketched two figures: one with a regular head and another with two horns protruding from the forehead.\n"See, this one is a Sola, and this one is a sprite. They come from different families. Their families told them they were born to be enemies because they look different."\n"But... why can\'t they be friends?" Fina asked softly, biting her lower lip.\n"They couldn\'t do that, at least not at first. But one day, a fairy gave them each a book called the Elysian Canon. Through it, they realised that their souls were no different from each other\'s, and that they were meant to cherish and love each other instead of fighting."\n"Ah... so it\'s like Mommy and Daddy!” Fina exclaimed, beginning to understand. "Daddy has horns, and Mommy doesn\'t. But you still love each other, and you had me."\n"Yes, my dear," her mother smiled, tenderly kissing Fina on the forehead. "Just like how Mommy loves Daddy, and how we love you."\nFina\'s fairy tale began with the "Elysian Canon," but in the end, it was also the very reason things fell apart.\nOne night, the guards of Icelake burst into Fina\'s home unannounced, ransacking the place with brutal efficiency. Fina\'s mother hid with her in a cramped space beneath the basement, listening as the soldiers\' boots pounded the floor above like a relentless storm. Fina could hear her father arguing desperately with the guards, fragments of heated words reaching her ears — something about "illegal possession of Elysian scriptures" and "worshipping false Elysian gods"... Then came sounds of a scuffle and the heavy thud of a body hitting the floor... Her mother clamped a hand over her mouth, silencing her screams and cries as Fina held her breath, clutching her fear tightly.\n"Daddy\'s gone to a faraway place.

        text: "\"Fizz—\"\nFina's mother struck a match, and a tiny, cheerful flame danced to life atop the blue candle, casting a gentle glow over the small cake. This was Fina's first birthday celebrated within the grand walls of this mansion.\nFina and her mother had been living in this opulent home for several years now. The house resembled something out of a fairy tale, with golden crystal chandeliers casting dreamlike patterns on the luxurious wallpaper. Each time the chandeliers were lit, Fina was reminded of the circus she had seen as a child — particularly the iron cages where the animals waited before their performances. The heavy brass lock on those cages, shimmering in the sunlight, seemed almost identical in hue to the chandeliers.\nIn this beautiful mansion, \"birthdays\" were a privilege reserved for her younger half-siblings. Fina usually snuck into the parlour after the lively parties ended, hoping to coax a plain piece of cake, stripped of chocolate and fruit toppings, from the maids. But today, with the master of the house away on business, Fina finally had a birthday celebration to call her own.\n\"Happy birthday, Fina!\" her mother said with a warm smile.\nFina's eyelids fluttered, trying to muster a smile as joyful as her mother's. Yet, her eyes couldn't help but linger on the bruises marring her mother's arms. Those weren't accidents — they were the marks left by her stepfather's cane. The man's temper was erratic: a spike in Phoxene prices, a business deal gone sour, a losing hand at cards, or even something as trivial as an unpalatable tea could set him off. And when he did, his fury was often directed at his Charon stepdaughter, whether or not she had anything to do with his frustrations. When Fina's mother intervened to protect her, she too bore the brunt of his rage, as evidenced by the stark marks left by his cane.\nThis brave mother, though adorned in finery, was like a canary trapped in a gilded cage, struggling even to protect her own fledgeling. Yet, despite everything, Fina was not afraid. Though her mother belonged to the mansion by day — to its master, Fina's half-siblings, the clink of glasses in the parlour, and the rustle of silk in the ballroom — at night, she belonged to Fina. Every night, her mother would steal up to the small attic room, sit by Fina's bed, and tell her wonderful bedtime stories, humming lullabies until she drifted into dreams.\nUnlike Fina, who was often tearful, her mother rarely cried. She didn't cry when she lost her parents and husband, nor during their funerals, which she organised all by herself. She didn't cry when forced into a strategic remarriage by greedy relatives, but instead made a deal with her new husband, trading her family heirlooms for the chance to keep Fina by her side. And she never cried when her new husband's fury rained down on her, even though her defiance only invited more insults and beatings. She would simply smile at Fina and whisper, \"Don't worry, the pain will go away soon.\"\nNoticing Fina's gaze, her mother subtly adjusted her shawl to cover the bruises and gently stroked Fina's hair. \"Make a wish, sweetie,\" she whispered. Fina nodded, closing her eyes, and silently wished, \"Dear God, please let me become as strong and brave as my mother.\"\nWhen she opened her eyes, her mother was gone, and a large white bird plush had taken her place. Its long, soft feathers were as white as Fina's snowy hair, and its wings spanned broader than her arms.\n\"Chirp chirp! Nice to meet you, Miss Fina — I'm your birthday gift!\" came her mother's voice from behind the plush. \"Let's be friends!\"\n\"Wow... hello, Mr White Bird!\" Fina exclaimed, stretching out her arms to hug the big bird tightly. The plush's soft feathers tickled her cheek, enveloping her in comforting warmth.\n\"He's like Daddy,\" Fina murmured softly. \"Daddy also had big, strong arms that could hold both Mommy and me.\"\nThey both knew which \"Daddy\" she was referring to, though it was left unsaid. After a brief pause, Fina suddenly heard quiet sobs. She quickly released the plush, peering around it to check on her mother. For the first time, she saw tears in her mother's eyes.\n\"I'm sorry, Fina...\" her mother sobbed, burying her face in her hands. \"I should have taken you away from here... I was foolish to think that you'd be better off in a whole family.\"\nLooking at her mother's gaunt face, Fina saw herself — the little girl who tried so hard to hold back tears and put on a brave face to spare her mother from worry. At that moment, Fina realised that her mother, too, had once been a little girl with childish giggles and tears of weakness, yet she had been holding back her tears and acting strong for her child.\n\"It's okay, Mommy,\" Fina said softly, pulling the plush's wide wings to envelop her mother. \"When I grow up, I'll have big, strong wings too. I will protect you.\"\nResolved to mature quickly for her mother's sake, Fina envisioned herself as a knight from her bedtime stories, strong enough to drive away all the villains. It was after this birthday that Fina first noticed a faint glimmer of magic at her fingertips.",

But her mother didn\'t seem pleased — her face was etched with worry, and she sternly warned Fina to keep her abilities hidden from others.\nFina figured it must be because she wasn\'t strong enough yet, and that her mother was worried for her safety. So, whenever she had the chance, she would secretly practice her magic in her room. With no textbooks or teachers, she turned to her storybooks for guidance, imagining the fairies as her mentors. Gradually, she learned to weave the fantastical "friends" from the fairy tales into reality.\nOne afternoon, while her mother and stepfather were away, Fina saw her little brother crying in the garden, with no servants around to comfort him. "He must be very lonely and scared right now," Fina thought. After a moment\'s hesitation, she gathered her courage, walked over, and gently took his tiny hand in hers.\n"Shh," Fina whispered, blowing gently on the back of his hand. "It\'s okay. I have a little surprise for you, here—"\nAs Fina opened her hand, several butterflies fluttered out from her palms, dancing gracefully around the garden, which had turned stark in the winter. The little boy, intrigued, clumsily chased the beautiful creatures, his tears turning to laughter. Magic could indeed bring happiness, Fina mused, watching her brother\'s cheerful face, unaware of the servant\'s cold gaze from the shadows.\nFina couldn\'t understand why the servant would report her magic abilities to her stepfather, just as she couldn\'t fathom why an organisation called the "Legion" would forcibly take gifted Charon children from their families.\nAmidst the loud arguments and the sound of shattering glass in the parlour, Fina realised one thing: magic — the powers that she had been granted to protect her mother — had led to their impending separation.\n"Why did things have to turn out this way?" she asked Mr White Bird.\nMr White Bird did not respond, gazing at Fina with his round, black eyes.\n"If you could fly, would you take Mommy and me away from this house of pain?"\nMr White Bird remained silent, his fluffy wings tenderly enveloping Fina.\nDeep into the night, Fina was roused from sleep by her mother. She didn\'t say a word, and only the aggressive pattering of rain against the attic window filled the silence. Bleary-eyed and confused, Fina noticed her mother was dressed in a dark, flowing cloak.\n"Mommy, what\'s wrong?" she murmured, "Are we going somewhere?"\n"Yes, sweetie. I\'m taking you to a new home," her mother replied softly, pulling her up and slipping a coat over her shoulders. "It\'ll be like the cosy little cottage from your favourite storybooks."\n"Is Mr White Bird coming with us?" Fina asked.\nHer mother paused, a hint of sadness crossing her features. "We need to travel light. I\'m sorry, honey..."\nRealisation dawned on Fina — this was not an ordinary outing, but an escape. \n"Then let\'s leave Mr White Bird here to keep my brother and sister company," she proposed, securing the scarf her mother handed her. "As long as I\'m with Mommy, that\'s all that matters."\n"My sweet baby," her mother whispered, tenderly stroking her child\'s hair. "Once we\'re settled, Mommy will work hard to bring you more friends — not just Mr White Bird, but also puppies, ponies, butterflies... all the friends you like."\nFina nodded, then approached the door. Suddenly, she turned back, carefully tucking the plush under its blanket, making sure it wouldn\'t catch a chill.\n"Goodbye, Mr White Bird," she whispered to the plush tenderly. "Don\'t worry, I\'ll be with my Mommy. Take good care of yourself."\nFor a moment, she thought she saw Mr White Bird wink at her, his wings giving a soft flutter as if bidding her a safe journey, "Chirp chirp, little nightingale, God-speed."\nTip-toeing after her mother, Fina silently descended the spiral staircase. One last time, she looked up at the crystal chandelier. In the gloom, it shimmered with a faint golden light, as if countless eyes were watching over her.\nAs they opened the door, a bolt of lightning split the sky, and the cold rain greeted them harshly. Fina couldn\'t help but shrink back. Her mother unfurled an umbrella, creating a small oasis of calm amid the storm. "Let\'s go, Fina."\nThis call cleared all the fear and worries in Fina\'s mind. Clutching her mother\'s hand, Fina braved the rain.',

        text: '"Fina, I\'m home—"\nAs night fell, with the wind howling and snow swirling outside, Outsider pushed open the wooden door adorned with a small bird motif, carrying a bag of discounted groceries he had carefully picked out from a street vendor.\nThis small, humble house was Fina\'s new home.\nIn this simple dwelling, there were no beautiful dresses, fine china, or glittering gold... Yet it was a place where she no longer had to worry about stumbling over the hem of her long dress while trying to curtsey, endure cold leftovers served on elegant plates, or fear a thrashing from an exquisite gold cane. Instead, there were kirtles carefully sewn from rough linen, warm soup served in chipped wooden bowls, and a lovely nightlight made from scrap glass.\nAs the snow melted into droplets on his coat, Outsider haphazardly wiped them off with a towel and moved to the stove to start preparing dinner. Soon, the enticing aroma of cooking filled the air. Fina closed the half-finished picture book she was drawing in, carefully placing it on her lap to make room for the warm soup Outsider brought over.\nIt was just an ordinary evening — until a harsh knock rattled the old wooden door. Standing outside was a well-dressed gentleman, clutching a familiar gold cane. Upon seeing the cane, Fina\'s utensils clattered to the floor, along with the picture book and pencils in her lap.\n"Mr Outsider, I presume?" The gentleman removed his hat with a polite nod. "I am Morris Glenville. Thank you for taking care of Serafina, my runaway daughter. I\'ve come to take her home."\n\nOutsider turned to see Fina shrinking into a corner, her small form curled up in fear. Her eyes, wide with terror, brimmed with tears. No words needed; Outsider understood what he had to do.\nHe stepped forward, shielding Fina with his body. "Please leave. She is my sister, not your daughter."\n"Perhaps there\'s been some misunderstanding, sir," Morris replied with a chilling smile, his eyes growing colder. "Her status isn\'t for someone of your kind to determine." He produced a pistol from his coat, aiming it steadily at Outsider. "You may have heard of me — I have little patience for pointless negotiations. Rest assured, I mean no harm if you understand your place. In fact, I\'m even prepared to offer you a generous reward for your troubles in caring for my daughter these days."\nHe then turned to Fina, still cowering in the corner. "Come now, my dear. Be a good girl — just give Daddy the box your mommy gave you and come home."\nNeither Outsider nor Fina responded. Morris\'s patience began to wear thin. He pressed the gun to Outsider\'s forehead, raising his voice. "Don\'t test my patience. I\'m going to count to ten. If you don\'t cooperate, I\'ll have to resort to less civil means."\n\n"Ten."\nFina\'s gaze fixed on the pistol. She remembered that stormy night two weeks ago — the very same gun had taken her mother\'s life. The bullet had been meant for her, but her mother had shielded her from it. She fell to the ground, blood gushing from the wound like a crimson blossom in the rain.\nShe kept saying, "Run, Fina. Don\'t look back."\n\n"Nine."\nFina looked to Outsider. His hand was hidden behind him, discreetly reaching for the hilt of a dagger, yet trembling slightly. Even Fina, who had rarely left home, had heard from the servants what fate awaited a Charon who dared to harm a Sola.\n"Eight."\nFina\'s mind raced back to that rainy night. She had run with all her might, her stepfather and the servants\' footsteps closing in behind her. She had called forth Mr White Bird from her fairy tales, who briefly slowed them down. But just when she gasped for breath, relieved at her escape, her foot slipped, and she tumbled into the icy torrent.\nIn the darkness, she felt the cold water pulling her deeper into an abyss darker than the stormy night. She struggled desperately, grasping at splintered planks that could barely keep her afloat; she also felt rotting vegetables and sharp, slimy fish bones. Eventually, she lost the strength to hold on, letting the current drag her to an unknown fate.\n\n"Seven."\nFina remembered that rainy night. As the water engulfed her, Fina thought to herself, "Maybe I\'m going to join Mommy and Daddy in another world." She felt her consciousness, her memories, and her very essence ebbing away. "Mommy," she murmured weakly, "Mommy."\nPerhaps her cry reached the heavens — she thought she heard footsteps halt beside her. Then she felt gentle arms pull her from the cold darkness. It must be Mommy, she thought, and she finally drifted off to sleep.\n\n"Six."\nFina recalled waking in an unfamiliar room. The room was tiny, smaller even than the attic she used to live in; the bed was hard, harder than any servant\'s bed. But a beam of sunlight had found its way through a crack in the roof. Dust motes danced merrily in the rays before settling on the back of a stranger, yet she wasn\'t afraid. The image reminded her of her mother — when she was very little and still had a "home," she would always wake up to see her mother\'s silhouette in the morning light.\n"Mommy," she whispered hoarsely to the figure. "Mommy..."\n\n"Five."\nFina remembered the day she called Outsider "Mommy." He had crossed his arms, utterly baffled. "Don\'t you mean \'Daddy\'...? No, wait, I\'m not that old... \'Brother\' would be the right title."\nBut her mind was in a fog, and she couldn\'t bring herself to figure out the situation. "Mommy," she kept muttering. Outsider eventually shrugged, resigned. "Alright, whatever you like."\n\n"Four."\nFina\'s hand discreetly fumbled around her. Since she was severely wounded from falling into the sewer, her faint magic powers hadn\'t recovered. She groped desperately for anything that might help.\nSuddenly, her fingers brushed against something cold and hard — it was a gun. Outsider\'s gun.\n\n"Three."\nFina remembered how Outsider was clueless about caring for a child when she first arrived. She missed her mother a lot and was always tearful. Failing to comfort her, Outsider frustratedly raked his hands through his hair. Then, a spark of inspiration struck — he rummaged and retrieved a gun from the cabinet, carefully removing the bullets before handing it to her. "Here, take this. When I was a kid, this was my favourite toy."\nHowever, the sight of the gun — the same kind of metal that had taken her mother\'s life — only intensified Fina\'s sobbing.\n\n"Two."\nFina remembered how Outsider fell silent when she tossed the gun away. But eventually, he still picked it up and placed it back in her hands. With a mix of seriousness and tenderness, he told Fina—\n"Don\'t fear this thing," he instructed softly. "I\'ll teach you how to master it. Though it\'s dangerous, it\'s the only thing you can rely on to protect yourself and the people you care about."\n\n"One."\nFina remembered her little birthday celebration. That day, she wrapped her mother in the wings of her Mr White Bird plush. \n"Fina will protect Mommy."\n\n"Zero."\nThe plush bird\'s feathers fell like snow, clouding her vision.\n\n"Bang—"\nThe gunshot echoed.\nMorris Glenville staggered backwards, his frame hitting the ground with a heavy thud. Disbelief etched his features as he collapsed, a dagger piercing his heart and a bullet hole in his chest.\nThe gun tumbled from Fina\'s hand, the smoke from the muzzle curling up into the air. She looked towards Outsider, her sweet smile tinged with sadness. "Outsider, now we\'re both \'bad sorcerers,\' aren\'t we?"',

Once, she had been consumed by deep hatred and fear for the man who had brought so much misfortune into her life. But now, memories of him had melted away like snowflakes caught in her hair, dissolving into distant oblivion.\nHer hair had grown longer, and Outsider had helped to dye her silver locks a beautiful shade of azure, like the waters of Lamenting Lake or the colour of her eyes. This new appearance allowed her to walk among the crowd without being recognised. The name "Serafina Glenville" had been carried away by the winds over Icelake, leaving behind only Fina, Outsider\'s sister. A new chapter of her story was ready to unfold.\n\nOn a clear afternoon, Fina opened a blank notebook, picked up a quill, and carefully wrote down the title of her new story: The Song of the Niveous Nightingale.\nSuddenly, a clattering noise interrupted her thoughts. She set down the pen, intending to ask her brother to be a bit quieter, only to see him approaching with a cardboard box in his hands. "You might want to go over these," Outsider said as he placed the box on the table. "I forgot to mention — I found this bundle near you in the sewer. Thought it might belong to you."\n"This is..." Fina gasped as she lifted a small box from the carton. Though caked in mud and dust, the intricate craftsmanship was evident. "The family heirloom Mommy left to me."\n"Wow, that sounds awesome! Let\'s see what\'s inside — maybe it\'ll turn us into rich folks, so we can buy a bigger house." Outsider joked as he wiped away the grime. "Huh, there\'s a combination lock on it..."\n"Wait!" Fina suddenly remembered her mother\'s warning. "Don\'t open it! Mommy said it could explode if the wrong password is entered!"\nShe jumped up, trying to grab the box, but before she could, there was a soft click.\n"It didn\'t explode," Outsider said, puzzled. "I just tried a random number and it opened. But there\'s nothing much inside, just a piece of paper." Realising the potential significance of this thing, he immediately handed the box to Fina. "Maybe you should read it yourself."\n\n—What could it be?\n"Could it be... a treasure map?" Fina wondered, tilting her head as she unfolded the paper. Suddenly, she choked up, and her hands began to tremble. Outsider leaned over, only to find a thin letter, with just one line of elegant handwriting:\n<H>My dearest child, may you find your own happiness.</>\n\nFina\'s thoughts drifted back to a night many years ago, when she had been jolted awake by a nightmare. Frantically, she had run downstairs in search of her mother, only to pause outside the bedroom, overhearing a conversation between her mother and stepfather.\n"Morris, I promised I would give you the treasure in the box someday. But it’s not today — it\'ll be the day when Serafina comes of age," her mother said, her voice calm and resolute. "In exchange, I\'ll need your assurance — you must ensure Serafina grows up safe and well."',

        text: 'On a quiet street in the southern outer city of Icelake, a woman who ran a small bakery was still waiting for one of her regulars to return.\nMore than a decade ago, she had no storefront — just a humble stall set up on that same street. Every morning, as she prepared to open for the day, she would hear the silvery, ringing voice of a child singing from one of the upstairs windows. Though she never saw the one who sang, she came to think of that child as an unseen companion — someone who, like her, was greeting the morning with effort and hope. Whenever she grew weary or close to giving up, just hearing that voice was enough to keep her going.\nOne day, the woman noticed that the song from upstairs sounded different. Though no musician herself, she could hear the change — the notes felt distracted, uneven, as if something weighed heavily on the child\'s heart. It continued for several days. Then one morning, the child\'s singing broke off mid-note, followed by a sudden sharp cry. Startled, the woman rushed upstairs — only to run into a flustered Charon boy.\n"Ma\'am, my mother — she\'s fainted! Please, we need help... please!" the boy stammered, barely able to form his words.\nShe froze for a beat. That voice — she recognised it immediately. There was no doubt: this boy was the singer, the unseen companion whose voice had greeted her morning after morning.\nGathering herself quickly, she helped the boy bring his mother to a nearby clinic. With treatment, the woman\'s condition stabilised, though the boy refused to leave her bedside. Seeing he hadn\'t eaten all day, the baker returned to her stall, filled a basket with bread, and brought it to the clinic.\n"Thank you... thank you so much, ma\'am," the boy said again and again. "I—I don\'t even know how to repay you."\n"Just call me Auntie Horrel," the woman replied with a smile. "And no need to thank me — you\'ve helped me plenty, too."\nThe boy blinked in confusion.\n"Thanks to you," she said, "I\'ve had free opera performances every morning. I\'ve been meaning to tell you — child, you sing beautifully."\n"Th—Thank you, Auntie Horrel!" the boy stammered, surprise flashing across his face, along with a trace of shyness. "But... my mother always said we shouldn\'t accept kindness without giving something in return."\n"Then next time," the woman chuckled, "just come and buy a piece of bread at my stall."\nIt had been an offhand remark, something she\'d said without thinking. Yet from that day onward, the boy really did start coming down every few days to buy a piece of bread. Through small exchanges, Auntie Horrel gradually learned more about him. He had never known his father. For as long as he could remember, it had always been just him and his mother. She had been frail for years, but recently, her health had begun to decline more rapidly.\nAuntie Horrel prayed quietly for the boy and his mother. Yet the boy\'s singing never returned to what it once was. No matter the tune, a thread of sorrow was always woven through it. Listening to his voice, she often found herself overcome with quiet sadness. There was little she could do to help, so she did what she could — each day, setting aside the softest, fullest loaf she had, saving it just for him, hoping that its simple warmth and sweetness might ease, even if only a little, the sorrow he carried.\nThen, one day, the singing stopped. And the boy no longer came to buy bread.\nMany days passed, until Auntie Horrel happened to catch sight of him again — walking down the street, hollow-eyed and lost in thought. She called out to him at once.\n"Why don\'t you sing anymore?" she asked gently.\n"My mother passed away," he replied. His voice was dry, brittle. "I used to sing to make her happy... but now that she\'s gone..."\nAuntie Horrel fell silent for a moment. Then she placed a warm bag of bread into his hands.\n"Your mother once told me," she said, "that she hoped you\'d grow up to sing on a real stage someday. A bright one, where everyone could hear your voice. Even if she\'s not here anymore... you can still make that wish come true."\nThe boy looked up, a faint light stirring in his eyes.\nIn truth, the woman had only met his mother a handful of times. She remembered only a reticent figure who always kept her face hidden beneath hats and veils. But none of that mattered now. The only thing she could offer the boy — was one small lie, told with kindness.\nThe next morning, his singing returned. Perhaps because it had been silent for so long, it now carried a deeper strength — and a greater tenderness — than ever before.\nYear after year, the snows of Icelake fell and melted again. The boy grew into a young man, and the woman\'s humble stall became a proper bakery. One ordinary morning, just before opening time, someone knocked at the shop door.\n"Auntie Horrel, I\'ll be away for a while," the young man said, handing her a small pouch of coins and a house key. "I\'ve enlisted in the Legion. While I\'m gone... could you look after my home?"\n"Of course. But I can\'t take your money," the woman said softly, pushing the pouch back towards him. "You\'re living all on your own — you\'ll need it far more than I will. But why the Legion? Aren\'t you going to sing anymore?"\n"I want to earn my place as a Laurelled Charon. That\'s the only way I\'ll ever stand on a real stage," he explained, nudging the pouch back towards her. "Please take it. I can\'t accept your help for nothing."\n"Then repay me when you come back," she said, handing him the loaf she\'d already set aside — the softest, as always. "When you make it big, come and be the face of my bakery, alright?"\n"If you\'d have me..."\n"Then it\'s a promise." She waved him off with a warm smile. "May your dream come true, Parsifal."',

As with all gatherings of its kind, the room pulsed with the worship of wealth and the hunger for status, gilded over with empty courtesies and polished flattery. And yet, amid all the glitter and pretence, a fairytale romance was quietly about to unfold.\nIt was his first time attending a banquet of such grandeur. He was dressed impeccably, his manner carefully composed — yet the unease in his eyes and the stiffness in his posture betrayed him. Young and sharp, he was a self-made businessman whose fortune in the steel trade had finally earned him a seat among the city\'s elite. Yet no tailoring could mask the humble roots he wore so plainly, and everyone in the hall — himself included — could see it. Eyes followed him with quiet amusement. Polite smiles met his greetings — just a shade too condescending — only to give way, behind his back, to snickers over his outdated taste and clumsy small talk. After being coaxed by a sharp-tongued noble into downing three glasses of biting spirits, he quietly slipped into a shadowed corner and murmured a request for a glass of plain water.\nShe was a darling of the inner city\'s social scene — no stranger to banquets like this. She navigated the endless stream of admirers with practised ease, making each one feel like the only one. With a few carefully chosen words, she even managed to calm two young gentlemen who had nearly come to blows over her. From the corner of her eye, she caught sight of a baron — the same one who had given her an extravagant necklace only a few days earlier. He was with another woman now: young, beautiful, someone she didn\'t recognise. It hardly surprised her. In the eyes of these nobles, she was no different from a fine porcelain vase — expensive, ornamental, replaceable. Crack it, stain it, grow bored of it, and there would always be another. But unlike a vase, she could do what no ornament ever could — speak, and smile. With grace, wit, and charm, she could always make herself sought after again. It was a game she played to perfection — and always won. Just as she gathered her skirts, poised to rejoin the game with all her polished art, a sudden wave of dizziness caught her off guard. Perhaps it was the wine she had just downed. She turned towards the refreshment table instead and caught sight of a plate of freshly sliced lemons. She picked one up — a small habit of hers. A sharp jolt of sourness always helped to clear her head.\nTo avoid staining her white gown, she popped the whole lemon wedge into her mouth. When she looked up, she found the man staring at her, water glass in hand, utterly bewildered.\n"...Isn\'t that sour?" he asked.\nShe could only nod, cheeks puffed full, and managed a muffled "Mhm."\n"Then why eat it?"\nShe tapped her temple lightly, meaning to say: to wake herself up.\nThe man stared at her for a moment — it was hard to tell whether he understood or not. But then, he picked up a wedge himself, mimicked her exactly — and the instant he bit down, his features twisted into a full, miserable grimace.\nShe chuckled softly, covering her mouth with a handkerchief as she gracefully spat out the rind. Then, with practised composure, she asked, "Feeling a bit more awake now, sir?"\n"Y—Yes... thank you, miss. You\'re... very beautiful," he stammered, nearly choking on his water. The words could easily have sounded like sarcasm — but to her, they were the most sincere thing she had heard all evening.\n"My name is Herzeleide Snowfield," she said. "I don\'t believe we\'ve met. And you are?"\n"Morris Glenville. I\'m a merchant."\n"A merchant?" she echoed, tilting her head slightly, her gaze curious but free of the slightest condescension. "And what kind of trade are you in?"\nHe smiled. "A bit of everything. Though lately, I\'ve been thinking of trying fruit imports — maybe something a little less sour than these."\nShe laughed. And so did he.\nAnd so, in a hall of blinding splendour, two kindred souls found each other — in a corner softened by shadow, where the gilded light could not quite reach. Like a lemon sinking into a glass of water, the bitterness softened — just enough to leave a hint of sweetness.\nFairytales are fairytales because they end just in time — while the illusion of "happily ever after" still holds, shielding the reader from the ugly truth that waits beyond the beauty. Once the curtain falls, all that remains is the cold weight of reality.',

Some adored her — hopelessly smitten, longing to set her upon a pedestal and proclaim her the perfect woman. Others loathed her — sneering that she was nothing but a lowborn seductress who had clawed her way up by charming powerful men, eager to see her dragged back into the dirt.\nBut who was she, really?\nShe was born into an ordinary Charon household. Orphaned young, she took work as a maid in an inn to fend for herself. She was clever, meticulous, hard-working — until the night her beauty caught the wrong kind of attention from a nobleman staying at the inn.\nThe hearts of Icelake's folk were like the lake itself — cold to the core. No one pitied this lowborn Charon girl, even knowing full well she was the victim. She was cast out in disgrace, branded with shame, and left to scrape by in the slums.\nShe thought she would rot there, forgotten. But fate wasn't finished toying with her yet.\nYears later, the same nobleman returned — sickly, dying — and, perhaps seeking to soothe his conscience before the end, he showered her with gifts: wealth, a home in the inner city, even the hollow honour of a Laurelled Charon's title.\nTo the world, it looked as though she had struck gold overnight. To her, however, it was nothing but a sick joke. No apology, no fortune could ever mend the hollow torn open inside her. No one could imagine the life she had been forced to endure — the pain that clung to her like a second skin. She came to despise mirrors, and anything that dared reflect her face. She hated her beauty. She hated her own naivety. Because the world had taught her it was her fault: Why hadn't she been plainer? Why hadn't she known better?\nThen, everything turned on its head overnight. Her beauty — once a curse that had damned her — became a prize nobles worshipped. After a brief stunned hesitation, she steeled herself — and chose revenge. She would learn their games, speak their tongue, and wound them where it hurt most. She crafted herself a surname of elegance. She immersed herself in etiquette, literature, the arts, and current affairs. Before long, her beauty and sharpened mind made her the most coveted courtesan in all the inner city.\nShe drifted from gala to gala, relishing the quiet satisfaction of turning nobles into puppets of their own longing — pulling at their strings with effortless grace. Her heart, day by day, froze into something unrecognisable. She all but forgot the girl she had once been. Until the day she met him.\nHe wasn't a noble. He, too, wore a mask at every glittering gathering. And because of that, he saw through hers — glimpsed the loneliness buried beneath the dazzle. She believed it to be fate's final mercy — a chance to reclaim the self she had lost to the world. Beneath the hush of a tender night, she laid bare her heart. In his presence, even amid the glittering halls and their hollow splendour, her heart could beat warm and alive once more.\nMonths later, when she discovered she was carrying his child, her heart overflowed with joy. But the man grew hesitant. His business had already soared; wealth alone no longer satisfied him. What he craved now was standing — privilege, acceptance. And she, a Charon, could offer him none of it. She was like a fish flung from its tank, left gasping on cold floor. She pleaded. She reasoned. She said she had connections, that she could help grow his ventures. She cried. She humbled herself. At last, he relented — and made a single, conditional promise: If the child was born Solarian, he would make her his wife.\nOn an autumn night beneath the silver moon, her child was born. He was a beautiful boy — fair-skinned, delicate, lovely — and on his brow, a pair of small, black horns. They were beautiful horns, gleaming faintly at the tips — rare even among Charons. It was believed that children born with such horns were destined to awaken as Daimons.\nShe stared at those tiny horns, her heart sinking into despair. With trembling hands, she fumbled for a knife. If only the horns were gone. It was all their fault. If she were to cut them away... she could still have her happy ending.\nBut just as the blade caught the cold gleam of the moonlight, the baby opened his eyes — and looked at her. In those clear, bright eyes, she saw her own reflection.\nShe, too, bore horns. Horns just like his. Only then did she realise: after all these years, she had never truly stopped hating herself — or denying who she was.\nSlowly, she set the knife down.\nShe gathered the child into her arms and whispered:\n\"Come, my little one. Let's leave this place.\"\nThus ended the tale of Herzeleide — once a belle among the glittering halls of the inner city.",

        text: 'I was born in the outer city, into what you\'d probably call an ordinary household — though in truth, it wasn\'t all that ordinary. I never knew my father. My mother raised me on her own.\nBefore she grew too sick to leave her bed, I remember her as full of energy. She worked cleaning and tending to the Galea Theatre — arranging the scenery, sweeping the seats, checking the lights and fittings — whatever needed doing. Because of her job, she heard every kind of opera there was. And when she came home, she\'d sing. She loved singing. Whether she was resting or scrubbing the floors, there was always a tune on her lips. Simply by being there — listening day after day — I started to sing along with her.\nWe lived a modest life — but with music always in the air, somehow, it felt like enough. Until she fell ill. I can\'t remember exactly when it began, but I do remember that winter. It was one of the coldest winters in my memory, and her health suddenly took a sharp turn for the worse. Before, a few days\' rest would be enough for her to recover. But that time, even as the snows melted and spring returned, she remained bedridden. The doctor said it was the result of a frail constitution and the wear and tear of years spent working too hard. There was no cure. All we could do was let her rest — and hope for the best.\nWith Mother no longer able to work, the strain at home grew heavier with each passing day. One day, she called me over, her voice more serious than I had ever heard. She asked me to bring out a box from under the bed — one I had never seen before. It looked far too fine — far too out of place in our modest home. I was even more taken aback when I opened it:\nInside were a few pieces of ornate jewellery — each one looking far more valuable than anything we had ever owned. And at the centre of it all, nestled among the necklaces and bracelets, was a badge. Engraved upon it were the words "Laurelled Charon" — and Mother\'s name. I realised then that her past might have been far more complicated than I had ever imagined.\n"Take these pieces of jewellery and sell them," she said. "It should last us a while. But don\'t go by yourself — ask someone from the theatre to help. Otherwise, you might be taken advantage of."\nI nodded and carefully took the jewellery from the box. There were letters in there too — quite a few, in fact — but she glanced over and simply told me to leave them and put the box away.\nI didn\'t ask any questions. But she must have seen the curiosity in my eyes — because she spoke again: "Just some old things... from the days when I still lived in the inner city."\n"Mother... were you rich?" I asked.\n"If you mean in terms of money," she said, almost absently, as if dismissing some long-forgotten dream, "then yes. There were always gorgeous gowns in my wardrobe — and if one ever got torn or stained, I never minded. There were always new ones waiting. I had enough jewellery to wear something different every day. And if I fancied something new, I never had to buy it myself. I\'d just mention it at a ball, and a few days later, someone would bring it to my door in a ribboned box. All I had to do was dance with them once or twice. If I hadn\'t left the inner city, the house would probably be filled with flowers and expensive tonics by now."\nAs she spoke, the last of the sunlight brushed across her face. She looked beautiful — worn thin by time, yet touched with a fragile grace. I couldn\'t read her expression. Was it nostalgia? Or regret?\n"Mother... do you ever regret leaving the inner city?" I asked.\n"Regret?" She smiled — and somehow, that smile made her look all the more fragile, all the more beautiful. "Those ten years I spent in the inner city... they were like soap bubbles in the sun — gleaming, shimmering, yet couldn\'t withstand a single touch. Sometimes I even wonder if they ever truly happened at all."\n"But the days I spent after I left — the life I built here — every moment of it was real. I remember the day I first learned the layout of the theatre, and the moment I knew by heart where every tool belonged. I remember when I dressed the entire auditorium by myself. I remember the first callus on my hand, the first ache in my knees, and the first wrinkle at the corner of my eye." She reached out and touched my cheek. Her palm was roughened by time, but it carried nothing but warmth. "And I remember you, Parsifal. The first time you sang along with me. The first time you memorised an entire score. The first time you sang through a whole act without missing a note."\n"I have never once regretted leaving the inner city." She looked into my eyes, her voice steady with quiet sincerity. "It was the best decision I ever made."\nI don\'t know much about the inner city. I could never quite picture what life there might have been like. But I believe her. Even though Mother gave up many things, they were losses she had chosen — willingly — for a life that felt right to her. I want to live as she did: walking a path of my own choosing, with no regrets.',

        text: 'I still remember the first time Mother took me to the theatre. It was early spring, and for once, Icelake had a clear sky. The snow had melted, and the streets smelled fresh and clean. She held my hand as we walked.\n"Mother, what\'s a \'theatre\'?" I asked.\n"It\'s where people perform operas," she said. "An opera is... well, people take on roles from a story, and instead of just acting, they sing it."\n"Like when you and I sing together at home?"\n"Something like that — but not quite. You\'ll understand once you see it," she said with a warm smile.\nAs a child, the theatre was the most magnificent building I had ever seen. Outside the grand entrance, elegantly dressed men and women stepped down from velvet-lined carriages. I felt like a shepherd boy who had stumbled into a palace.\nMother led me through a side door and introduced me to Madam Putsch, head of the Magic Flute Troupe. They seemed like old acquaintances — Madam Putsch had been the one to help my mother find her job. While they spoke, a beautiful woman peeked through the backstage door — then, in a flash, she was right in front of me, vigorously ruffling my hair.\n"Aww! What a charming little gentleman! You must be Herzeleide\'s boy, right? Look at those eyes — you\'re the spitting image of your mother!"\nThat was the first thing Miss Violetta — who would later become my mentor — ever said to me. To be honest, I didn\'t think much of her at first. She seemed overly theatrical — and ruffling my hair without even asking first felt incredibly rude. The rest of the troupe struck me as strange too. Feeling out of place, I tucked myself into a corner of the lounge as soon as my mother started working, and sat there quietly on my own.\nI didn\'t know how long I\'d been asleep before Madam Putsch woke me. She told me the day\'s performances were over, and that only the troupe was left in the building. I was free to wander the stage and the auditorium if I liked. Truth be told, all I really wanted was to crawl back into my corner and go on sleeping. But it felt rude to turn down her kindness, so I dragged myself towards the stage.\nSomewhere beyond the stage, a faint song began to drift through the air. I remembered what my mother had said — about people singing stories instead of just acting them. Could this be opera? I followed the voice, step by step, as it grew steadily clearer — until at last, only a curtain remained between us.\nLater, I would learn it was the main stage drape — not just any curtain.\nCurious, I tugged the curtain aside, and brilliant light spilled across my face, dazzling me. There she was — Miss Violetta, standing alone in the spotlight. But... was it really her?\nAs she moved gracefully around the stage, a living forest seemed to take shape in the empty space:\nShe lifted her hem and tiptoed forward — like crossing a babbling brook.\nWhen she ducked her head and brushed aside her hair, it was as if a low branch had caught playfully at her curls.\nShe raised two fingers to her lips and winced, as if tasting a wild, tart berry.\nAnd when she smiled tenderly with quiet wonder and reached out her hand, it was to greet a deer hidden among the trees.\nHer clothes hadn\'t changed, nor had her face. She was still that same abrupt woman who had tousled my hair without so much as a by-your-leave. And yet, standing there, I could have sworn she was someone else entirely.\n"Oh?"\nHer eyes caught on me. She approached, her steps light and graceful. Bending low, she drew the curtain wider, bringing her face level with mine. "Are you lost, sweetheart? The forest can be a dangerous place. Let me show you the way out."\n"Are you... Miss Violetta?" I asked hesitantly.\nShe widened her eyes in confusion, and shook her head.\n"You\'ve mistaken me for someone else. I\'m White Rose. I live in a windmill cottage — east of the forest, west of the lake."\nMy mother had taught me to sing for as long as I could remember. But it was then, hidden behind the curtain, that I first dreamed of becoming an opera performer.',

        text: "After being barred from performing, I turned to my teacher for help — to take me into the inner city, in search of my birth father, Morris Glenville.\nI found his name while clearing out Mother's belongings after she passed away. She had never spoken of him while she was alive. Of course, I had asked about my father once when I was little, but she had only given me a blank look and said, \"I don't know.\" I imagine there were memories too painful for her to revisit. If I hadn't been utterly out of options, I would never have considered turning to that man.\nBut I truly had no other choice. We all want art to be just art — pure, untouched by the hypocrisy and prejudice of the world. But in Icelake, that's a dream as fragile as a snowflake — delicate, fleeting, and quick to vanish.\nI stood for a long time in front of the grand estate, gathering all the courage I had before finally pressing the doorbell. A maid answered. She told me Mr Glenville wasn't home and wouldn't be back that day, then closed the door with quiet finality. I lingered there for a moment, the winter wind slicing against my cheeks. I was just about to leave when I heard a girl's voice:\n\"Give my Mr White Bird back... please...\"\nShe sounded sad — desperate, even. It was a tone I knew all too well. I didn't need to see her face to know how helpless she must have felt. Without thinking, I hurried towards the voice, circling around to the back of the house. Suddenly, a flash of white came tumbling down from above. I caught it by reflex — soft, warm, as if it had wrapped me in a gentle embrace. It was a plush white bird, nearly half my height: round, puffy, and a little comical, like something out of a storybook. I figured this must be \"Mr White Bird.\"\n\"Hah — looks like he ran off,\" came a shrill, mocking voice from the balcony above. \"Guess he didn't like you much, huh?\"\nIt was the maid.\nI heard frantic little footsteps scurrying away. A door slammed somewhere upstairs, cutting the sound short. Silence fell — and then, faintly, came the soft sound of a little girl quietly sobbing from the balcony.\n\"...Mr White Bird...\"\nI stepped out of the shadows, the plush bird nestled against my chest, and edged closer until she came into view.\nShe couldn't have been more than twelve or thirteen, with snow-white hair and sapphire eyes — like the young heroine of a fairy tale. And to my surprise, she was Charon. Morris Glenville was Solarian, which could only mean he had married a Charon woman. The thought gave me a sliver of hope: If he already had a Charon child... maybe he wouldn't turn me away either.\nThe girl spotted me and froze mid-step. I put a finger to my lips, signalling her to keep quiet, then steadied myself and tossed the plush bird back towards the balcony. (Thank you, Dennis, for forcing me into endless games of catch with your little siblings — without that training, I would never have made the throw.)\nShe caught Mr White Bird against her chest. The doll was soft and light, but even so, the force of it sent her stumbling. She dropped to her knees with a small thud, then scrambled upright again, clutching the doll close, her eyes shining with pure joy.\nShe mouthed a silent, heartfelt \"Thank you.\"\nI nodded and made to leave — but before I could turn away, she began waving her arms in an excited, frantic series of gestures I couldn't quite decipher. Then, without a word, she vanished back inside. I hesitated, lingering there in the cold. A minute later, she reappeared on the balcony, clutching something small. She tossed it down — a square of paper, neatly folded.\nI caught it, unfolded it carefully, and found a simple sketch inside: a boy holding a white bird aloft. It took me a moment to realise — she had drawn me. At the bottom, in careful, elegant handwriting, it said: \"Thank you, big brother! You're so kind!\"\nBig brother.\nThe words struck harder than I expected. In that instant, I realised — yes, I suppose she really was my little sister.\nI tucked the little drawing carefully into my coat pocket, then dipped into a deep, theatrical bow — just like a storybook fairy granting the heroine's wish.\nShe giggled.\nAnd just then, a quiet thought bloomed inside me: I'd make a good big brother. I would read her fairy tales by the fire. I would play dolls with her. I would tell her how wonderful her drawings were. I would sing her lullabies when she couldn't sleep. And if she ever wanted, I would teach her to sing.\nBut that little fantasy melted the instant I came face-to-face with Mr Glenville — as fast as snow vanishing against bare skin. Looking back, it should have been obvious: If that girl had ever been truly cherished in the Glenville house, no servant would have dared to treat her that way. I should've known.\nI could never be her big brother. There was nothing I could offer her, nothing I could change. She and I were the same — two children trapped in separate cages, both dreaming of a sky we could never reach.",

The wife was a Ferrywoman — one who guided the souls of the departed through a sacred rite of water burial. This ritual, rooted in the ancient traditions of the Charon people, stood in defiance of the doctrines upheld by Elysium's Orthodox Church. And so, it was strictly forbidden. Only through whispered conversations between trusted friends could one learn of the Ferrymen — and where to find her.\nAt first, it was only those few Charons who still clung to the old ways that dared make the journey — on foot, through the forest — to ask the Ferrywoman to send off a lost loved one. But as resentment towards the patricians of the Church deepened, this quiet funeral rite became something more: a silent act of rebellion. One by one, more souls chose to leave this world in the arms of the Misty Sea, rather than in the sanctified embrace of the Church.\nEventually, the whispers reached the ears of the Church's informants. And on a moonless night, the executioners came — torches in hand — and stormed the forest. The two heretics were dragged from their home and burned at the stake. Their remains were cast beyond the border, into a pauper's grave — a place where no stone marked the dead, lest they defile the sacred soil of Elysium.\nAnd thus ended the legend of the Ferrywoman. But for a time after, another tale made its way through the whispers of the common folk. They said that on the morning after the execution, someone saw a child crawl out from that grave. Her chest bore a wound clean through the body. Her small form was drenched in blood and ash. Her face, blackened with soot. And yet her eyes — clear, sharp, and unmistakably alive — were not the eyes of someone at death's door.",

And yet, each time, the voices quieted at the hush of her song, with each dancing step she took, dissolving into the trailing folds of her gown.\nDeep within the Slumbering Woods, many souls still wandered. The ritual had taken longer than usual. When Nifle finally came to a stop, a breeze stirred her veil. It had been months since the battle. The scent of blood had long since faded — now, only the earthy breath of leaf and soil filled her lungs. She closed her eyes and turned her face to the wind, allowing herself to feel the land once more.\n"Each land has its own breath." It was a line she had once read. Now, standing once again on this soil after decades away, she finally understood what it meant. In that peaceful moment, wrapped in the fragrance of memory, her thoughts wandered to a time long past — quiet walks through the woods, always a few steps behind that bright figure, laughter light and silver as windchimes.\nA rustle of footsteps stirred the stillness. She opened her eyes. Among the trees — a flicker of colour. A girl stood before her, cradling a bundle of wildflowers. For a heartbeat, the figure seemed to blur — overlapping with someone long lost to memory. Her face carried a resemblance Nifle hadn\'t seen in years. And for a moment, she thought she heard the girl call her name — soft, joyful, like a voice drifting through a dream.\nThen the vision passed. The girl blinked, curious. "Hello, ma\'am," she said politely. "I don\'t think I\'ve seen you around before. Are you from far away?"\nHer voice rippled through Nifle\'s thoughts like a pebble cast into still water, drawing her gently back to the present. Nifle smiled gently. "Yes, my child. From a very long way away."\n"But... you sounded like someone from around here."\n"When I said \'a very long way,\'" Nifle raised a hand and gestured to the horizon, "I did not mean distance."\nThe girl tilted her head, puzzled — but her gaze soon drifted to the lantern in Nifle\'s hand, its pale glow pulsing like breath.\n"Are you a Ferrywoman?" she asked. "Did you come for... the departed?"\nNifle nodded. "I\'ve just guided the wandering souls of this forest to the Misty Sea."\nThe girl lowered her gaze, and a note of sorrow crept into her voice. "...They were my people," she murmured. "The people of Aethyrie could not kneel to Hyperborea\'s rule. Nor return to the gods who turned their backs on us. So we stood — shoulder to shoulder — and fought for freedom and dignity, with nothing but our flesh and blood. Some called it foolish, reckless, pointless. But I don\'t believe that. Do you, ma\'am? If we lost the war... does that mean their sacrifice meant nothing?"\n"All lives must end," Nifle said softly. "But thoughts endure. The fallen lie like monuments left incomplete — someday, freedom will come to carve their names where they belong."\nShe paused, as if remembering someone.\n"Those were the words of an old friend. I hope they bring you some comfort."\n"Your friend must have been very brave," the girl said with a smile. "Thank you — for guiding them home. Now they can finally rest in peace."\nShe bent to place the wildflowers at the roots of an old tree. After a quiet moment, she rose and turned to leave — but paused, glancing back.\n"My grandmother once told me a story about a Ferrywoman in a black veil, carrying a lantern... gentle as the night itself. You remind me of her."\nYou remind me of your grandmother, too, Nifle thought. But she kept the words to herself.\nInstead, she offered a soft smile and bowed her head.\n"It\'s time I moved on.

She never ages."\n"Wait — that\'s real? That\'s... incredible. Must be nice."\n"But... to outlive your own child — to say goodbye with your own hands... that must hurt more than anything."\nThough the whispers were hushed, they still reached Nifle\'s ears, carried on the evening breeze. Yet the words stirred nothing in her. She had long grown used to the awe, the envy, the wonder — and the quiet sighs that followed wherever she walked.\n"It\'s time," said the young attendant beside her. "The rite is ready."\nNifle gave a slight nod. She lifted her lantern and stepped towards the river, where the water glowed faintly beneath the night sky. Moored at the bank was a slender boat — and resting upon it, a delicately carved coffin.\nThe woman within lay surrounded by blossoms, her eyes peacefully closed — as if merely dozing in a sunlit chair. The years had carved themselves into her: fine lines by her eyes and lips, skin dulled and weathered, strands of grey falling soft beside her temples. To any other, she was a woman well into her twilight years. But to Nifle, she was still a child. Through that aged face, she could still see all her past selves — the bright-eyed little girl with laughter full of wonder, the quiet student lost in the lamp-lit hush of the library, the slender figure crossing battle lines for her nation\'s survival, the silver-haired scholar who stood at the lectern, her eyes softened by time, yet shining still.\nNifle had expected deep grief — the kind she had once felt when guiding old friends to the other shore. But in this moment, what rose within her was something quieter: a strange sense of calm and release.\nOne by one, she lit the candles arranged around the coffin. Then, from the folds of her robe, she drew a small stone — its surface ridged and grooved with cracks — and placed it gently upon the woman\'s chest.\nIt was a fragment of a meteor — and the fulfilment of a promise long kept. That day, Nifle had planned a rare visit to the market — and asked if her child wanted anything. The girl — truly just a little one then — had lit up, eyes sparkling as she clutched at Nifle\'s sleeve. "A talking star," she\'d said.\nOf course, no market could offer up a star — let alone one that spoke. The child had always been full of whimsical, impossible ideas. But Nifle had promised she would find one, someday.\nChildren forget the promises made to them when they are very young. But Nifle never forgot the one she made to her daughter.\n"I\'ve brought you your talking star, Aletha," she whispered.\nNifle had once read Aletheia\'s journals. As a child, Aletheia held fast to her own odd beliefs. She didn\'t believe the priests of Elysium, who said the stars were gemstones set into a vast glass dome — arching over the world, and known to all as "the sky." Nor did she accept the tales of the Charon, who claimed the stars were golden leaves hanging from the limbs of a great world tree. She believed that each distant star was its own world — like Atlasia itself. And perhaps, to those stars, Atlasia was also just a "star" — a single speck of light, twinkling back across the void.\nIf that were true, then this meteor shard — lined with ancient veins — might still whisper of a distant world, across time and space.\nNifle looked down, one last time, at the elderly woman who had once been her child. Then, gently, she closed the coffin. With steady hands, she pushed the boat into the river, letting the current carry it away. She rose — and with the same grace etched into every motion, began the Dance of Departure.\nBehind her, soft sobbing stirred the air. In the edge of her gaze, the crowd stood still upon the riverbank — their eyes fixed on the drifting boat in silent reverence. Candlelight shimmered in their eyes, a scattering of stars upon the earth.\nAnd in that moment, Nifle understood: The child had stopped asking for stars — not because she had forgotten, but because she had become one. A quiet light above Aethyrie\'s sky, eternal and unwavering, illuminating the path ahead.',

Nifle accepted it and took a sip — then immediately doubled over, coughing hard as the burn hit her throat.\n"Haha, should\'ve warned you — that\'s wine." The woman chuckled. "Cold weather like this, a few sips can warm you right up. But if you\'re not used to the taste, maybe don\'t overdo it. Wouldn\'t want you dizzy later."\nNifle gave an awkward smile and handed the waterskin back. The woman patted her lightly on the shoulder, then turned to check in on the others.\nAmong the migrants, aside from Erika and Alexis, no one knew that the quiet, delicate girl walking among them was the "blessed girl" once worshipped upon the altar. For the first time in her life, Nifle found herself living as an ordinary person — with friends, with companions.\nTheir journey began beneath the shadow of the Sacred Tower, passed through the Emerald Forest, and continued ever northward. Here, the trees shed their yellowed leaves at the first bite of cold. The north was nothing like the sun-blessed southern lands, those long favoured by the gods. And yet, even here, Nifle felt something within her begin to thaw. Her dearest wish now was to fulfil the promise she had made to Erika: to find a place where they could live freely, and build a new home.\nBut that wish was too much to ask of the times. The knights of Elysium gave relentless chase, outnumbering the migrants many times over and wielding weapons far more refined. Again and again, they launched assaults. And each time Erika returned from battle, her body bore new wounds.\n"Let me go in your place," Nifle said. "I can\'t be hurt."\nBut Erika only smiled and shook her head. \n"I have to go," she said. "No one else can take my place."\nErika\'s final battle was fought not against kings or gods — but against her own father. On that day, Lord Generous himself led the charge, declaring a crusade against his daughter in the name of purging heresy. The tragic clash between father and daughter ended with both falling upon the field. At the very moment his sacred bow, Mammon, sent an arrow through her chest — Erika\'s lance found his heart.\nWhen Nifle found Erika amid the wreckage, the warrior was already fading — her breath shallow, life slipping away. In desperation, Nifle reached for her dagger, ready to slice open her own wrist. The blood in her veins — the so-called "golden blood" — had once repelled death itself. But Erika, though barely conscious, raised a trembling hand to stop her.\n"This wound is fatal," she whispered, voice faint but firm. "Even if you kept me alive... I would never truly recover."\n"I can keep you alive forever!" Nifle cried.\nBut Erika only shook her head. "That wouldn\'t count as living. I want to die a warrior — here, on the battlefield. I\'m sorry... but I won\'t be able to go with you... to that land of freedom we dreamed of."\n"Why...?" Nifle bowed her head, tears spilling freely as she trembled from head to toe. "This blood in my veins — it\'s meant to save lives, isn\'t it? So why can\'t I save you? If I can\'t even save you... then what\'s the point of my life?"\n"Nifle..." Erika reached out, gently cupping her friend\'s tear-streaked cheek with a calloused hand hardened by years on the battlefield. "That bastard of a father of mine... he might\'ve been right about one thing. You really are a child blessed by the gods. Your life... must have a very special purpose. And I believe... you\'ll find it someday."\nBut Nifle didn\'t understand. Not then. All she could do was hold her friend\'s body, already growing cold, and let the tears fall, unrestrained.\nAfter Erika\'s passing, the migrants continued northward. Their journey stretched on — long enough to shake off the knights of Elysium, and longer still, until at last, they were free. But in the end, arms that once embraced drew blades against one another, and wine once shared spilt into blood-soaked soil. The road to freedom was lined with thorns and littered with broken oaths. Nifle witnessed more sorrow, more partings. But she also began to understand: Though life was full of uncertainty, and death inevitable, the brave still had the right to choose — what to live for, and what to die for. Death held no meaning... until they gave it one. That was the privilege of mortals.\nBut that privilege eluded Nifle. She could not choose death. She could only live — and keep living — as everything she loved faded, one by one, before her eyes.',

She would walk, step by step, towards the sanctum throne — bathed in reverent gazes, her feet treading soft petals scattered in her path — just as a true Divine Herald was meant to do.\nThen Lord Generous himself would step forward, presenting a chest of glass phials — clear, flawless, and empty. And the rite of blessing would begin.\nShe was the chosen of the gods. And as such, she was expected to transcend mortal pain. That was why the blood had to be drawn in the oldest way — no fine needles, no herbs to dull the pain. Such things would profane the rite, reduce it to something clinical, something cruel.\nThe blade must be beautiful. Silver, gilded, engraved with the crest of the golden iris. Cold as the sanctum's stone, sharp enough to part flesh with the gentlest touch. Blood, deep and red, would slide into the phial. And with it came that sickly-sweet metallic scent. It was anything but divine, yet the heavy incense of the sanctum would quickly drown the scent out.\nOne phial would fill. Then another. And another. Until the grateful praises of the faithful blurred into a far-off murmur, and the blade slipped from her grasp.\nThe gates of the sanctum would close with a thunderous boom, sealing out the desperate eyes beyond. She — now little more than a hollowed vessel — would be carried back to her chamber by the maids, the veil lifted from her face. Then came hours of stillness. Eyes wide open, she could only watch as the wounds on her arm slowly closed, as pale skin flushed faintly with life once more, as the cracks on her fingers knit together with impossible precision.\nAnd so, she was made whole again — no different from the day before, or the one before that. Waiting to be veiled once more. Waiting for the next chest of gleaming, empty phials. Waiting.\n\nThat day, footsteps came outside her chamber door earlier than usual. It wasn't uncommon. Whenever important guests visited, Lord Generous would instruct the maids to prepare an extra supply of \"golden blood.\"\nBut this time, there was only one set of footsteps — and a voice she'd never heard before. Bright, unfamiliar, full of life. It spoke softly from beyond the curtain.\n\"Hello? Um... are you the Divine Herald?\"\nShe sat up at the sound, but gave no reply.\n\"Hey! You're awake!\" The voice brightened. \"I'm Erika. My father said I'm not supposed to come in here, but... well, I thought you must be bored. I mean, being stuck in this room all the time? That sounds awful. Don't you want to go outside? Just for a little while? It's still early — no one will notice.\"\nShe opened her mouth, trying to respond — but the long-silent cords had forgotten how to make sound.\n\"Hmm? Is this not a good time?\" The voice hesitated for a moment. then brightened again. \"That's fine! I'll come back another day then!\"\nNo. Don't leave.\nDragging her weakened body forward, the chains that bound her limbs scraped against the bedframe, grinding out a jarring, metallic screech. Her throat trembled with effort. A sound broke free — rough, hoarse, barely human.\n\"Hel...\"\n\"Miss Herald...? Did you say something?\"\n\"He... help... me...\" She forced the words out, one broken breath at a time.\n\"Hmm?\"\nThere was a pause. Then the curtain flew open. And she came in — bringing sunlight, wind, and the scent of a world still full of life.\n\nLater, Nifle learned that Erika was the daughter of Lord Generous himself. After uncovering the truth behind the so-called \"golden blood,\" Erika began visiting her in secret at dawn. She would bring food, teach her to speak, and share stories of the world beyond those locked doors.\n\"Miss Herald — no, Nifle. I'll get you out of here. I promise.\" She said it one day, her eyes meeting Nifle's without hesitation, her voice steady and sincere. Nifle had thought it no more than a kind lie — a moment's warmth, meant to ease her pain. But Erika kept her promise.\nOn the day of their escape, Erika unshackled Nifle's chains and lifted her onto her back. Though they were the same age, Nifle's body was so light, so fragile, she weighed no more than a child.\n\"You're light as a feather...\" Erika murmured. \"When we reach the north, I'll make sure you eat well. You'll grow stronger. We'll ride horses together. We'll learn to shoot arrows together.\"\n\"Okay,\" Nifle whispered, and nodded, a faint smile curling her lips.\nMany years later, whenever Nifle found herself leafing through the history books of Atlasia, her mind would return to the night she fled the sanctum of Lord Generous. She had ridden on Erika's horse, arms wrapped tightly around her rescuer's waist. Unlike Nifle's paper-thin skin, Erika's waist — firm from years of training — felt solid and sure. It made Nifle feel safe.\nThey galloped through the night, the wind roaring in her ears, the city fading behind them. The horse finally came to a stop at a camp, where Nifle met Erika's comrades for the first time. She looked at the faces gathered around the fire — faces marked by warriors' bold laughter, by farmers' sun-etched furrows, by scholars' brows drawn deep in thought, and bards' lips cracked by years of song. The firelight danced in their eyes. To Nifle, they were nothing like the faces she had seen from high above the altar. \nTheir eyes burned just as brightly — but not with desperate prayers begging for divine mercy. No — the fire in their eyes spoke of longing. A longing not to be saved, but to build a new homeland with their own hands and feet planted firmly in the earth.\nTogether with Erika's companions, Nifle became part of a far greater escape — one that later generations would remember as the Great Migration. A chapter of history so profound, no retelling could ever truly capture its weight. It was a movement born of defiance. The people of Elysium's lower castes, no longer willing to kneel beneath the yoke of theocracy, placed their faith in a wise leader and marched north — into the uncharted wilds, in search of something they could finally call their own.\nAnd for Nifle, it was the same. She had escaped the sanctum and stepped into life — not as a symbol, nor a vessel, but as herself.",

A drop of dew slid down their plump skin and fell.\n"Wha— !?" The girl jolted fully awake and scrambled up from the grass. "Has the hunt started already?"\nHer father chuckled, holding the berries between his fingers. "You begged to come along first thing this morning — and then fell asleep on my back halfway through. Hunt\'s over, sweetheart. Time to head home."\n"Aww, I missed it all!" she pouted, cheeks puffed out. "Why didn\'t you wake me up?"\n"Alright, alright — next time, I promise," he said, giving the berries a little shake. "Here. These are sweet. Try one — might cheer you up."\nStill sceptical, the girl took one and popped it into her mouth. A hint of tartness mingled with the sweetness as the juice spread across her tongue, and the gloom lifted from her face.\n"What are these berries called?" she asked.\n"Those are raspberries. Forest\'s full of wild fruits — but only a few you can eat. And raspberries? Sweetest of the lot."\nThe girl snatched another handful from his palm and tugged at his hand, ready to head home.\n"Daddy, I want more..."\n"Alright, two more — okay, three. But the rest\'s for your mum, okay?"\n"Why are raspberries so small? Wouldn\'t it be better if they were bigger?"\n"Well, you just have to wait till it grows up. First it turns into a gooseberry, then into an apple. And if that apple keeps growing... bam — melon."\n"Wow... then what will I become when I grow up?"\nHer father chuckled, gave her hair a gentle ruffle, but said nothing.\nAt the end of the path, a small wooden house came into view. That was the girl\'s home. Her mother stood at the door, waving at them from afar. With a joyful squeal, the girl let go of her father\'s hand and ran towards her mother\'s open arms.\n"Goodness, look at you," her mother said, catching her and wiping the juice from her mouth. "You didn\'t sneak something into your tummy in the woods, did you?"\n"She didn\'t, I can vouch for her," her father said, chuckling as he walked up behind them. He pulled out a bundle of raspberries wrapped in a handkerchief and handed them to his wife. "We brought some back for you too."\n"Wow... they\'re so pretty, I almost feel bad eating them," she said with a smile.\nLaughing and chatting, the man and the woman walked off towards the kitchen to start preparing lunch.\nMeanwhile, the girl slipped away again, wandering down to a nearby brook. As she murmured the list of fruits her father had told her — raspberries, gooseberries, apples, and melons — mounds of them rose in her mind like tiny hills, one after another.\nThen suddenly—\n"Whoa...!"\nThe girl froze, eyes wide. Just within reach, a dragonfly spiralled down from the air and settled lightly on the tip of a tightly closed water lily bud. Its delicate wings caught the sunlight, scattering it into a shimmer of iridescent colour.\nShe held her breath, perfectly still — afraid that even the faintest motion might send the tiny, beautiful creature fluttering away.\n\nBack then, she longed to grow up. Everything was new in her eyes, and the world before her — vast, unknown — was filled with wonder.\nBack then, she didn\'t yet know she would one day witness every bloom and every withering, every meeting and every parting, every beginning — and every end.\nBack then, she was simply an ordinary child, watching a dragonfly perch on the tip of a water lily bud, her eyes bright with joy and wonder.',

The rise of the Drifters, for instance, had clearly never been part of their plan.\nAccording to the original design, anyone who took up violence without permission was to be shunned and despised. In practice, however, the opposite occurred: the Drifters carved out a long-standing presence in Huaxu\'s history.\nSome people began quoting an old line from the classics — "The righteous draw their blades, even if it means bending a few rules." And soon enough, all these hotheaded lawbreakers were lumped together as "the free-roving outlaws".\nAt first, folk avoided these outlaws who lived beyond the reach of the Nine Chapters of Dafeng, bold enough to stand against the Bi\'an and the Magistrates of Yingtian. People feared that one wrong word might earn them a sword to the midriff. Yet among the Drifters were those who couldn\'t stomach the bullying of the innocent, and they turned their blades on the vicious thugs who preyed on the weak.\nThus, even beneath the watchful order of the Nine Chapters, undercurrents and feuds began to stir. And as blades crossed time and again, it was those quick to act for the common good and fierce in their hatred of injustice who began to outnumber the common ruffians.\nBeyond the sight of the Nine Chapters, these righteous wanderers cut down those who twisted the law for personal gain, who trampled others\' rights for their own benefit. Cold steel was their answer to such scoundrels.\nToday, while most folk still frown at the mention of Drifters or "free-roving outlaws", these free-spirited wanderers have long grown used to drifting through the martial world, drawing their blades wherever they find injustice.

It was hardly a terrible flaw — few people live free of such burdens — but it did mean he wasn\'t entirely honest with himself.\nKezhou soon left that self-deception behind, and gave up practising the fist stances and sword forms he had invented for his imagined "drunken outlaw" self. Not because he had suddenly risen above it all in some moment of enlightenment, but because he gradually discovered he simply couldn\'t hold his drink. A few cups of rice wine would leave his shifu merely light-headed, his steps a touch unsteady.

Hardly the state for any "drunken outlaw" technique.\nPoor tolerance for drink is no great misfortune for most people. But for Kezhou, who dreamed of becoming a drunken outlaw, it was nothing short of a heavy blow.\nSo for a while he kept drinking, hoping to find that perfect balance between drunkenness and clarity — only for every attempt to end in a long, dreamless sleep. His shifu even began to suspect that his prized disciple must have fallen helplessly in love.\nIn the end, after Kezhou had tasted every wine Huaxu had to offer, he finally gave in to the truth. His capacity for drink had not improved in the slightest — though many other worries had faded along the way. As his dream of becoming a drunken outlaw ebbed, his nature grew more easy-going and free-spirited.

That was unusual.\nBy \"unusual\", it wasn't that Kezhou had popped out of a rock like some monkey in the legend, nor that he was a demon lord slipping free of an ancient seal. It simply meant that, in the memories he carried, his father actually existed.\nAnd that in itself was a rarity among Drifters, whose stories usually start with dead parents, a fall from a cliff, and years of secluded training in some peerless martial art they somehow \"accidentally mastered\".\nIn Kezhou's earliest memories, his father was much like any gentle, bookish fellow — patiently teaching him to read and write, day after day. Their household differed little from those of ordinary families across Huaxu. With a bit of luck, such a man might even have become a minor officer someday.\n \nThat impression was shattered after one particular lesson.\n\"That bright one in the sky is the sun. Its character is written like this: Ri. At night, the dimmer one comes out — that's the moon.\"\n\"I'm not stupid, Dad. You've told me that loads of times. Of course I know what the sun and moon are. And I know the sun's a giant ball of fire, and there's a moon rabbit grinding up herbs up there!\"\n\"All right, all right, my boy really is sharp. You know the sun and the moon are the most important things in the world. But there's one more thing — you can't see it, you can't touch it, and it's almost as important as the sun and moon. If you can tell me what it is, I'll give you a piece of osmanthus cake before bed.\"\n\"I want the cake first! I'll answer afterwards!\"\n\"It's wrong to expect something for nothing. Answer it correctly, and you'll have your cake.\"\n\"Fine, I'll answer. It's the wind — Dafeng. You can't see it or touch it, but we all have to live by the Nine Chapters of Dafeng.\"\n\"That's right. Now, if you want a second piece of osmanthus cake, let's recite the Nine Chapters a few more times today and try to remember at least half, shall we?\"\n\"No way. Dad, I don't think you're raising a son — you're training a mill donkey. Wave a carrot in front of its nose and it'll walk in circles for you. Sure, I like osmanthus cake now, so I'll play along. But what about when I get sick of cake, start yelling that I don't want to read anymore and want to learn martial arts instead? I'd like to see how you handle that.\"\n\"Ha! Don't you worry, my boy. Your old man has more tricks up his sleeve than you know.\"\n \nWith that, Kezhou watched his father head out to the woodshed and pull a sword from behind the stack of firewood, gripping it as if it were the most natural thing in the world. Before Kezhou could even ask why such an item existed in their house, a flash of silver swept before his eyes. His father burst into motion, brandishing the sword with movements as smooth as flowing water, each sweep stirring up a faint breeze. The display was so unexpectedly graceful that Kezhou could only stare, slack-jawed, before finally blurting out:\n\"I'm eight already. Eight years! How did you never tell me you could do that?\"\n\"There's a great deal you don't know about me.\" His father beamed, clearly delighted by his son's astonishment. \"Once you've learnt the Nine Chapters of Dafeng by heart, I'll teach you a move or two.\"\nBut that plan collapsed the very next day. Kezhou returned to being the same unruly boy as always — nodding off over his books and bursting with energy the moment it was time to play. The promise of learning swordplay from his father had already slipped far into the back of his mind.\n \nIt was not until many years later, after Kezhou had mastered all manner of swordplay himself and tried to trace his father's style to some school, that he realised the truth: those wild, flailing poses had been riddled with flaws and belonged to no school at all — most likely nothing more than a trick to coax his son into studying.\nBut something didn't add up. If his old man had truly known nothing of swordplay and had only been flapping about, how had he swung that sword so easily?\nSo Kezhou returned to Jiaolan Village for the first time in a long while. After losing his father, and then his mother years later, this was the first time he had returned to the place he once called home. He went straight to the woodshed, which now felt low and cramped to someone who had grown so much taller. After searching for a while, he finally found the sword.\nIt was far lighter than he remembered, giving off a faint rattle in his hand. The bright, metallic blade he recalled had been nothing more than a layer of silver foil, now dulled and peeling with age. Beneath the split foil lay a blade made of peach wood.\nKezhou could only let out a silent laugh. For a time, he had genuinely suspected that his father might be some hidden swordmaster living under an assumed name, and had even regretted not begging for instruction while the man still lived. It had never occurred to him that the entire display had been an act.\nPerhaps, in secret, his father had envied the Drifters and their unbound lives, and had made this wooden sword for himself to swing when no one was watching. Or perhaps it had simply been the toy he once played with as a child.\nWhatever the truth, Kezhou would never know. What he did understand was that his father had been completely ordinary — not a fighter or a hero, just a man who nagged his son to study and still found the courage to step in when others needed help.\n \nKezhou stepped out of the woodshed. The moonlight outside was clear and bright, washing the courtyard in a pale, familiar glow. As he looked up at that distant disc, memories of his childhood rose unbidden again. He could no longer recall whether the moon back then had been waxing or waning — only that it had been a half-moon, and that his father's face in its light had been hazy, soft around the edges, growing ever fainter in his memory as the years slipped by.",

Each lot is worse than the last!" He thought darkly, punctuating the thought with a burp reeking of fiery liquor. He knew full well it had been this way for a long time.\nTo most people in Huaxu, Drifters were little more than a noisy rabble of hotheaded youths and stubborn old men too ossified to straighten out — hardly a path anyone would call respectable. Youngsters with any real gift for martial arts were rare indeed. As a result, Drifters these days were no longer constantly on the brink of trading blows with each other. Far more often, they were busy flattering one another, keeping things amiable within their own ranks. Because of that, Yan Shanting often had no choice but to attend one master\'s celebratory feast or another, held in honour of whatever new disciple they had just taken in. There he would smile, drink, and make a fine show of courtesy, so that the bright-eyed novices would feel honoured — convinced they had chosen the right shifu and that the life of a Drifter was a respectable road after all. As for the disciple\'s aptitude... securing one at all was fortune enough — few had the luxury of being choosy.\nSo although Yan Shanting\'s own disciple kept urging him to drink less for the sake of his health, there was no persuading him. Ever since he had made a name for himself among the Drifters and earned the nickname "Master of Thousand Peaks", his old friends and rivals alike seemed to reach a silent agreement: they all became unfailingly courteous. Sparring matches turned into polite exchanges, and with compliments ringing in his ears, he would sit through yet another feast and stagger away thoroughly drunk.\n"Flowers bloom and fall, year after year. Young blades set out into the world and grow old on its roads. When I grow truly old, what face this martial world will be wearing by then?"\n \nMaybe it was the greasy roast goose from today\'s feast, or the sliced fish that hadn\'t been cooked quite long enough to lose its smell. Either way, Yan Shanting had barely finished his wistful remark when his stomach lurched — a hot, sour tide rising in his throat — and he promptly emptied the whole feast onto a heap of dead leaves along the mountain path.\nFor all his famed agility and effortless elegance in the martial world, Yan Shanting was no different from a farmhand when it came to throwing up — hardly a refined sight, and certainly not a pleasant smell. Before he had even finished retching, a figure burst out of the heap of leaves, flipped once in mid-air, shook the filth from their clothes, and brought a sword flashing down.\nYan Shanting jolted in shock, but with his stomach still heaving he had no strength to fight and could only stumble aside. Even so, the sword\'s edge grazed his sleeve and sliced a strip from his robe.\nHis black-clad disciple gasped and leapt between them, spear in hand, setting the shaft crosswise before his shifu.\n"Who are you? Why were you hiding in there to ambush my shifu?" he snapped.\nThe figure from the leaves sounded utterly unconcerned. "I\'m not fighting you — you didn\'t do anything to me. That old fellow threw up on me. I\'m fighting him."\nThe disciple frowned, taking a closer look. The intruder was a boy of twelve or thirteen — about the same age as himself — hair a tangled mess, clothes filthy, clearly used to living rough and with no manners to speak of. So he snapped again, "Don\'t you disrespect my shifu!"\n \nBy now Yan Shanting had finally caught his breath. He held his disciple back and said to the boy, "I dirtied your clothes. That was my fault. I apologise."\nThe boy showed no hesitation at all. "So you do know your manners. Good. Now then — for your apology, what are you going to give me to make up for it?"\nSmiling, Yan Shanting replied, "You\'ve got some skill yourself. How about I teach you a few sword moves?"\nThe boy remained unimpressed. "Your skills aren\'t that great. I cut your clothes to shreds without even trying. I don\'t want to learn from you."\nYan Shanting was left speechless. His disciple, however, had heard enough. Spinning his spear in a sharp flourish, he drove off the ground and shot forward like a streak of black-violet lightning.\nThe boy laughed and stepped back without the slightest hurry. The spear tip came close enough to punch a hole clean through him — only to miss by a hair as he knocked it aside with his sword, leaving the disciple\'s middle completely open. Even so, the disciple didn\'t panic. He flowed with the momentum, sweeping the spear\'s shaft up to guard himself. The boy\'s blade crashed against it in a spray of sparks — and the strike slid harmlessly aside.\nHe hadn\'t expected it to be a feint. As he gave ground, the boy had already backed against a rock wall. In one smooth motion he ran up the stone and vaulted clean over the black-clad disciple, sword driving straight for Yan Shanting.\nAdmiration flickered in Yan Shanting\'s eyes, but he dared not be careless. He drew his own sword and sprang forward to meet the thrust head-on — the only correct way to counter that technique. Step left, right, or back, and the follow-up would skewer him. That was why the move was called the Chain of Three Perils.\nSeeing Yan Shanting counter so cleanly, the boy gave a small sound of surprise, pulled his blade back in mid-air, and dropped to the ground in a steady landing.\n \nYan Shanting asked, "Not bad at all, boy. Who\'s your shifu?"\nThe boy sounded impatient. "I just copied the monkeys in the hills. If you really must know, then the monkey king with the reddest bottom up there is my shifu."\nYan Shanting was speechless once more, while his disciple Yuming looked ready to give this impudent brat another lesson.\nYan Shanting, however, took no offence. He simply put his easy smile back on. "You\'re a sharp one, lad. How about becoming my disciple?"\n"No. I told you — your skills just aren\'t that good." With that, Kezhou scooped up his sword and turned to leave.\nYan Shanting remained perfectly calm. "We just fought to a draw, didn\'t we? How about a wager? A few more rounds — as many as you like. If you can land a hit on me, I\'ll even let you be my shifu."\nAt that, Kezhou finally turned back, eyeing the grinning old man with open suspicion — then agreed to the wager.\nLater, looking back, Kezhou would feel he had been thoroughly tricked by Yan Shanting that day. But at the time, he had no inkling of what the future held.',

        text: "Kezhou didn't get on with his shifu at first — for reasons that hardly need saying. Young blood is like leaping flame or fresh bamboo shoots, always straining upwards, itching to break past the treetops and stab a hole in the sky. When that kind of momentum crashed headlong into Yan Shanting, Kezhou bristled in every way imaginable.\nAfter striking that wager with Yan Shanting that whoever lost would have to call the other shifu, Kezhou followed him into the mountains. There, he announced — to no one but himself — that this scrawny old man was his fated enemy, the one he simply had to beat in this lifetime. He even swore that one day he'd lop off the old man's beard and tie it to his sword-hilt as a tassel.\n \nKezhou launched into his great scheme before Yuming, trying his best to drag him into a joint attack on Yan Shanting. Yuming merely smiled. Kezhou took that smile as praise for his grand plan. Yuming, for his part, only thought him noisy and ridiculous — like one of the hill monkeys.\n \nFrom that spring onward, the sparrows outside Yan Shanting's thatched cottage were no longer the only ones making noise — there was the constant clang of metal as well. Those who didn't know better assumed the \"Master of Thousand Peaks\" must be hammering out swords and running a little forge on the side. A few even fancied that if his swordsmanship was that extraordinary, any blade he forged must be a treasure in its own right. Yet when they pushed through the bamboo grove and reached the cottage, all they ever saw were two figures: a young man, twin blades flashing as he circled a gaunt old figure who scarcely moved. On such a bright spring day, that little \"duel\" might have suggested a butterfly dancing around a flower... but the young man's strikes were far too fierce and deadly — enough to make one think of wasps instead. As for the gaunt figure in the centre, he was no flower either, but more like a weathered, gnarled old tree.\nIt goes without saying that the two figures — one all motion, the other barely stirring — were Kezhou and Yan Shanting. At times, Kezhou would close in, his twin blades whirling like a sudden gale, sharp enough that even drifting petals were cut clean into three. At other times he'd spring back, then hurl himself forward like an arrow loosed from a bow — as if trying to drive all the strength in his body into one decisive blow. Yan Shanting, however, never strayed beyond a patch of ground barely three feet across, merely turning and shifting his weight. When Kezhou's blades came in a flurry, he knew at a glance they carried more speed than power, and simply brushed them aside with his sword. And when Kezhou gathered himself for a full-force strike, Yan Shanting would read the path of the blow, and the one after it, and step neatly out of harm's way. Each day, there were always four or five moments when Kezhou felt he was no more than a hair's breadth from bringing Yan Shanting down. Yet that decisive strike was always just out of reach — close enough to glimpse, but never close enough to land. At dusk, Kezhou would stretch out on a smooth stone slab outside the cottage fence and sleep under the open sky, only to rise the next morning and begin the challenge anew.\nAs for why Kezhou set aside his sword and took up twin blades instead, the reason was simple. He might look a little simple-minded at times, but he was no fool. After crossing swords with Yan Shanting only a handful of times, he realised the old man was a master who kept his true edge well hidden. In pure swordsmanship, he was no match at all. His only chance was to switch to another weapon and try to gain the upper hand. His only worry was that if he struck too hard and actually felled the old man, that cold-faced disciple of his would come after him looking for payback.\n \nIn truth, he needn't have worried about that at all. By the time summer came, he was still no closer to laying a blade on Yan Shanting, even though he had grown far more skilled with the twin blades. Somehow, he was always just that little bit short.\nLying on the stone slab, he would replay every move of the day's bouts in his mind — only to have his thoughts scattered again and again by mosquitoes whining in his ears. In the end, he simply got up and set his blades moving, cutting the insects down one by one. The more mosquitoes he cut down, the more he sighed. If he was quick enough to slice a mosquito out of the air, then why couldn't he so much as graze that old man? The night was thick and inky, and in that darkness Kezhou seemed half mad, as if he bore some great grudge against the summer night itself.\nAt last, when his arms were sore and his strength spent, he let himself fall back onto the ground and stared up at the stars. The chirping of insects in the grass carried him back to a night from his childhood — a night when he and his father had sat together looking at the moon.\n\"Dad, which is farther away — that Hyperborea we read about, or the moon?\"\n\"The moon, of course. We've heard of people coming from Hyperborea, but never from the moon.\"\nKezhou tilted his head and protested, \"But when I look up I can see the moon — and I can't see Hyperborea at all. So it has to be farther away than the moon, right?\"\nHis father burst out laughing, and told him that the moon really was farther. It was just so far away that, wherever you went, it always looked the same distance from you.\nKezhou had been utterly taken with his father's words, staring up at the moon without blinking and wondering whether, one day, he might meet someone from up there and ask what those strange patterns on its surface really meant. As he stared and stared, the patterns on the moon seemed to shift, slowly turning into Yan Shanting's old face...\n \n\"Blimey! That nearly scared me to death...\" Kezhou gasped as he jolted awake, only then realising it had all been a dream. The sun was already up. Smoke curled from the thatched cottage in the distance, and the old man whose face had just appeared in his dream was standing there, watching him from afar with that same subtle smile. The sight made him itch to grab his twin blades and give the old man a couple more hacks.\nBut he knew perfectly well that even if he struck now, his blades would get no closer than that same inch from Yan Shanting's nose. That distance had nothing to do with him; it was entirely in the hands of that sly old fox. Just as, no matter how many mountains and rivers he crossed, the distance between him and the moon would never shrink by even a fraction.\nThe thought startled him for a moment — and then he burst out laughing. Until then, he had believed he could already glimpse the end of the path, that anyone whose swordplay surpassed his was simply faster, or just stronger in brute force. Now he realised that the peak he'd been aiming for was only one hill among many — and that there were always higher peaks beyond it.\n \nAt last, he made up his mind. He walked up to Yan Shanting and, in as respectful a tone as he could manage, said, \"Shifu, please accept your disciple's bow.\"\nYan Shanting was taken aback for a moment, then broke into a smile.\nRegrettably, it was not the warm, kindly smile of an old master welcoming a disciple he approved of, but the wicked grin of an incorrigible old rogue.\n\"Too late. I don't feel like taking you as a disciple now — not unless you master every weapon under heaven first.\"\nWith that, Yan Shanting picked up the seven-foot spear Yuming usually wielded and tossed it to Kezhou.\nKezhou froze for a heartbeat, then his temper flared. He caught the spear in one smooth motion and roared, \"Take this, you old fox!\" Then he leapt forward, thrusting straight at Yan Shanting's face.\nYan Shanting's smile didn't even waver. A mere inch from his face, he caught the oncoming spearhead between two fingers.\nTo any outsider, the thatched cottage was as lively and noisy that day as ever. ",

        text: "Spring had long since passed, yet the contest between Kezhou and Yan Shanting still had no clear victor — neither in skill nor in sheer stubbornness. At first, when Yan Shanting offered to take him as a disciple, Kezhou refused outright. Later, after their bouts left him in genuine awe of Yan Shanting's skill and he finally wanted to train under the old man, Yan Shanting — half out of mischief and half out of sheer obstinacy — turned him down right to his face.\nAnd so the two of them kept trading blows and sharp words. By the time winter arrived and the snow lay thick on the ground, Kezhou had mastered an entire armoury of weapons. And when he struck now, the edge of his blade came no closer than half an inch from Yan Shanting, instead of a full inch as before.\nHe reckoned that in another half-year or so, he would finally be able to land a proper blow on Yan Shanting. With that thought in mind, he made his way back to the space outside the thatched cottage.\nAfter the burning heat of summer had faded, the old stone slab he used as a bed at night had grown steadily colder. So, in late autumn when the wild geese were flying south, Kezhou spread a layer of reed down over the stone, then traded for some oilcloth and propped up a makeshift shelter with bamboo poles. It could not keep out the wind, but it kept off the rain well enough. By now, it was deep winter. Snow had piled on the oilcloth, bending the bamboo almost double. Seeing this, Kezhou hastened to brush the snow off. But he pushed a little too hard, and the whole shelter collapsed, white drifts tumbling down over oilcloth and bamboo in a messy heap.\n \nWind and snow swept past him, carrying the slow, distant tolling of a bell. All at once, Kezhou realised that it was New Year's Eve.\nHe wasn't sure why, but he suddenly found himself craving mutton soup — the good kind, with tiny beads of fat floating on top like scattered snow, dotted here and there with chopped spring onion. Kezhou shook his head, dismissing the thought. He had been away from home for years and had never paid such things much mind before. It was probably just the strange, biting cold that made him nostalgic.\nHe let out a sigh, his breath misting in the air. He bent to prop the shelter back up — only to feel a hand come to rest on his shoulder. When he turned, he found Yan Shanting's disciple, Yuming, standing there.\nHis tone was as cool as ever, but the words themselves were an invitation: \"Shifu's cooked a pot of yuanxiao. He told me to call you in to eat with us.\"\nKezhou froze for a moment, then turned him down just as coolly. \"I appreciate the invitation, but I'll pass. I'm only an outsider, after all.\"\nYuming's expression did not shift in the slightest. It was as if he had expected exactly that answer. He said nothing more and went straight back to the cottage.\n \nKezhou, for his part, acted as though nothing had happened and went back to fixing his humble shelter. But as soon as he bent down, he caught the faintest whiff of wine.\nHe turned and found a white porcelain wine pot, a thread of steam still curling from its spout, and beside it a parcel of food wrapped in a lotus leaf, giving off a wisp of warmth.\n\"Scraps out of pity, is it?\" he thought, indignant, turning back to fix his little shelter.\nEven fixed up, the shelter was still crude. When Kezhou finally had it standing again, he went inside and sat down, with the wine and food Yuming had brought laid out before him. He scooped up a handful of snow and held it in his mouth, thinking to stave off his hunger, but it only left him feeling colder.\nHe sighed again, his breath so cold it didn't even mist in the air. At last he couldn't hold back any longer — he reached for the lotus-leaf parcel and tore it open. Inside was a whole braised chicken, simmered until the meat fell from the bone at the lightest touch. Kezhou stripped it clean, not leaving so much as a scrap.\nAs for the wine, though it had cooled a fair bit, it sent a small, steady warmth through Kezhou's chest.\n \nThe next day, the snow ceased and the sky cleared. Kezhou once again asked Yan Shanting to take him as a disciple — and this time, Yan Shanting accepted with a smile.",

While there may have been some nascent science involving Charon and Daimon physiology behind it, the practice was still in its infancy. It was anyone's guess which readers possessed true wisdom gleaned from experience, and which were merely spouting auspicious nonsense to flatter hopeful parents.\nWhen Zhiliu was six, her parents invited a renowned Horn Reader to their home to divine her future.\nAfter praying to Lord Taihao and bathing in incense smoke, the reader removed her gloves to reveal perfectly manicured hands. She reached out to examine the tender horns on Zhiliu's head. They were sturdy like a stag's, black laced with amber veins, and tapered to dangerously sharp points. The reader fell into a deep, contemplative silence, her frown tightening before slowly smoothing out. When little Zhiliu looked up, puzzled by the stranger's long silence, the reader sensed her unease. She gently patted the girl's head and offered a parting blessing: \"Child, a magnificent life awaits you.\"\nIn a private conversation afterward, the reader spoke plainly to Zhiliu's parents. She predicted that Zhiliu would rise to the highest councils of Huaxu, becoming a figure of immense virtue and achievement. However, she also warned of a perilous path ahead, sensing the ruthless aura of a conqueror in the child's fate. Seeing the parents' expressions darken, the reader quickly added that Zhiliu's destiny was robust enough to turn misfortune into fortune, so they need not worry excessively.\nDespite the reader's reassurances, anxiety gnawed at Zhiliu's parents.\nThe Xuanheng Sect was known to scout gifted Loongscion children early, testing their character, intellect, and magic to recruit the elite.

They refused to send her for assessment.\nAfter much deliberation, they decided they valued a peaceful, happy life for her over one of power and struggle. Zhiliu's mother had old ties with Jingyuan, a disciple of the Wuqiongzang Sect.

I excelled at it all.\nPeople always called me a "prodigy," but I had limits. After months of this, my patience snapped. I was only ten, and I was desperate to learn actual spells. One day, trying to sound casual, I finally asked, "Master, how does reading all these books help us see the Mandate of Heaven? When do I get to learn the real spell arts?"\nMaster Jingyuan wasn\'t surprised. When I asked if she had divined my frustration, she laughed. She didn\'t need a ritual for that — my thoughts were written all over my face. If anything, holding my tongue for this long proved I had discipline.\nThe next day, she took me to the inner chamber. She showed me the rituals and seals but explained none of the theory. I simply mimicked her motions—until I was suddenly yanked into a strange, empty void. A flood of knowledge rushed in. For a split second, I saw the trajectory of the future. Then, I gasped back to reality like a drowning swimmer breaking the surface, the visions already fading like a dream.\n"Was that the future?" I asked. Master shook her head. She called it "Future Sight" — a projection based on what I already knew, subject to constant change. But I was too high on the thrill to really listen to her explanations.\nWith this new power in hand, I felt like a child with a brand-new toy. Naturally, I couldn\'t resist showing it off.\nBack home, I tested my skills. I foresaw my mother stepping on a loose stone by the alley and splashing mud on her favorite dress. That morning, acting mysterious, I warned her to avoid that path. Yet when she came home at sunset, the result was exactly the same.\nCrushed, I told Master Jingyuan. "Is fate impossible to change?" My distress amused her. She stroked my hair and explained gently: I had focused only on the result — the splashed dress. But had I considered the cause? It had rained the night before, and the roads were in disrepair. Hidden traps were everywhere, not just in that alley. To fixate on one specific path was short-sighted.\nIt was an illumination. Her words revealed the world in a completely new light — a vast web where every cause and effect is tied together by invisible threads.',

        text: "Years before assuming the mantle of High Chancellor of Loongyuan, I traveled the world as a Starweaver. My goal was twofold: to amass resources and, more crucially, to dissect human nature. The ancient arts of celestial navigation came to me not as a lesson learned, but as an instinct awakened. I held no love for coin itself, only for its utility — wealth is a shortcut to power, a universal key that unbolts the doors between men. I never hoarded my earnings; they were immediately funneled into the next venture. By weaving Master Jingyuan's teachings into my dealings, I danced between factions, expanding my influence until my humble trade snowballed into an empire.\nAt first, the sensory shock of new lands captivated me — the scorching, sun-baked sands of Khemet, the clinging, brine-heavy air of the Republic of Luca. Yet, novelty quickly eroded into monotony. It is hard to say which breeds a deeper isolation: the endless, static horizon of a sea voyage, or the disorientation of waking in yet another strange bed. Paradoxically, this distance from Haojing offered a reprieve. Stepping away from the crushing weight of my destiny allowed me to detach, to truly see myself and clarify my resolve.\nTo the world, Zhiliu must be a monolith — flawless, impenetrable, a being whose every second is dedicated to the mission. Yet, even I require a vice. In those stolen moments of leisure, I found my sole escape in the arts and literature of the Continent of Atlasia. Those masterpieces were windows into other possibilities, depicting tragic joys, infinite sorrows, and ideals that were as breathtaking as they were brittle.\nI once chartered a private airship to Scarletriver at an exorbitant cost, simply to catch a premiere before the sun dipped below the horizon. There, bathed in the dim, flickering glow of the stage, I watched the lives of others unravel and found a dark question taking root: Am I, too, merely a character in some grand tragedy, a moth driving itself blindly into the flame?",

Gold they never found — but through ceaseless study, they drew from Phoxene a substance known as Phoxichor. This faintly luminous blue fluid fuelled the rise of cities wrought from gears, furnaces, and steel. As looms devoured cotton to spin endless cloth, as railways spread like veins of iron across the land, as steel-clad ships soared like migrating birds into the sky, as cannons roared in human hands like the thunder of fallen gods — who could deny that Solarian alchemy had wrought miracles greater than any Charon sorcery?\n \nIt was only natural that alchemists became the Empire\'s most coveted profession. As the saying goes: "Between a pauper and a noble lies but a single Emerald Medal." Countless youths — hungry for knowledge, glory, or the chance to rise above their station — poured years into study and experiment, spent fortunes, and bartered honeyed words — all for a place at one of the Empire\'s alchemical institutes. Yet above them all towered the Royal Alchemy Academy in the capital, Dismania: a citadel of learning, admired from afar yet all but unattainable.\n \nThus, when Daphne Theodore renounced her place at the Academy and chose instead the life of an ordinary field medic, all agreed: she had lost her mind.',

These were not ailments that made corpses of people overnight, but over long years turned them into what the doctors came to call \"madmen.\"\nSince the age of seven, I'd been running back and forth along that corridor. My hands were quick, my feet quicker — faster even than most grown Solarian orderlies. And because all I ever asked for was a meal and a place to sleep, they graciously allowed me — a lowborn little Charon girl with horns on her head — to work in their domain. My tasks were almost always the lowest sort: hauling off soiled bedding, sweeping up shards of glass dropped by patients, dragging them to the washroom or the refuse yard. Now and then, a passing nurse would shove a crate of medicine or a bundle of vials into my arms to deliver. Most of the time, you'd find me staggering down that corridor with boxes taller than I was. They blocked my view, so I often bumped into people rushing past — and every time, I'd catch a torrent of curses for it.\nI once heard a bard in the square say Hyperboreans were the most short-tempered folk in all of Atlasia. If that's true, then by my reckoning, the ones at Riverside Hospital were the angriest of the lot — patients, doctors, nurses, even the kin who came to visit. Later I came to understand it was those long, drawn-out illnesses that drove them to the edge. But still, whenever someone barked at me, I'd raise a defiant middle finger at their retreating back.\nOnly once did someone bump into me and not curse, but apologise. Her name, I would learn much later, was Daphne Theodore.\nI remember it clearly. One afternoon, I was carrying a stack of underpads to the washroom when I collided at the far corner of the corridor with a young blonde woman. My underpads and her flowers both went flying, then scattered across the floor. Without missing a beat, I squatted down and wailed at the top of my lungs — louder than the most tormented patient. I wasn't hurt, not even upset about the mess. It was just a trick: if I howled like that, the adults who might scold or strike me would flinch and back off, like they'd brushed up against something filthy.\nBut the blonde woman didn't curse and scurry off like I expected. Instead, she knelt beside me, stroked my back with a gentle hand, and asked in a worried voice if I was hurt. She sounded more unsettled than I was. When I didn't reply, she tried again — even softer this time — though the tremble in her fingers gave her away.\nI don't remember what I said in reply — perhaps only, \"It doesn't hurt.\" Whatever it was, it eased the crease in her brow. She helped me to my feet, and together we picked up the scattered underpads and crushed flowers.\n\"I'm sorry,\" she said, giving my head a light pat. \"Little one, what flavour of sweets do you like? I'll bring you some next time, shall I?\"\n\"Strawberry,\" I told her. I shouldn't have accepted her apology — after all, it was me who hadn't been looking. But her question stirred something in me. I remembered the last thing my bedridden mother had murmured before she died: that there were strawberry boiled sweets in the cupboard drawer. When I looked, there was nothing. Only later did I find out my greedy brother had taken them all.\n\"Strawberry. I'll remember.\" The blonde woman gathered up her flowers and walked on toward the far end of the corridor. She was of middling height, slim and slight. The afternoon sun caught her matte hairpin, and for a moment it shimmered with a faint golden glow.\nI never knew her name, so in my heart I gave her one: Miss Strawberry Sweets.\nOther than my mother, no one had ever asked me so gently if I was in pain.\n \n— From the diary of Tiori Stone",

I\'d had no idea she was that strong. She shouted in my face, demanding to know why I\'d brought her the wrong medicine.\nI couldn\'t read, but I remembered every label by the shape of its letters — and beyond that, I recognised each medicine by its colour. Lots of medicines were blue, but only this one had that bright, glassy blue — the same shade as Phoxichor.\nI denied the accusation, but Nurse Madeleine raised her hand to strike me. I shut my eyes, wondering whether silence or sobbing might spare me another slap. But the first one never came. When I opened my eyes, the hand clutching my collar had been pried loose — her wrist caught fast in a slender, elegant hand.\nIt was Miss Strawberry Sweets.\n"Pardon me. I couldn\'t help but overhear your quarrel. Madam — before reproaching this Charon child, might I first see the medicine in question?"\nNurse Madeleine tried to jerk her arm free, but Miss Strawberry Sweets\'s slender fingers held fast with surprising strength. With a muttered curse, the nurse shoved the vial into her hand.\nShe held it up, gave it a slow swirl, then pulled the stopper and took a careful sniff.\n"There\'s no mistake. The girl gave you the correct medicine. This is AP-1718, as the label clearly states. You shouldn\'t lie in front of a child who cannot read."\n"That\'s not the right colour for AP-1718! This little twerp switched the labels!" Madeleine shrieked. "She\'s been sulking ever since her last punishment — trying to trip me up!"\n"The Alchemy Academy recently revised the formula. The latest batch differs from what you remember." She lifted her gaze, meeting the nurse\'s furious stare. "Rather than accusing an innocent child, Madam... perhaps you should spend more time familiarising yourself with your own medicines."\n"What new formula? You\'re just here visiting someone — how would you know? Who\'s to say you\'re not just covering for this little twerp?"\n"Oh, I know very well," she replied calmly. "My name is Daphne Theodore.

Daphne asked, as we sat together on the bench outside the ward.\n"Tiori."\n"Do you know how it\'s spelled?"\nI shook my head. She picked up a twig and traced a few letters in the sand.\n"This is your name. It means \'Dewiolet.\'"\nFor most of my life, my name had only ever come paired with words like "twerp" or "lowborn wretch." I never imagined it could mean something so beautiful.\n"Miss Dewiolet, may I teach you to write?" she asked gently.\n"Why should I learn to write?" I said, confused. Most of us Charons could only ever do hard labour, and I had no special gift that might make me a Laurelled Charon someday. I knew that much.\n"If you could read, what happened today might never have happened," Daphne replied, smiling softly. "Knowledge is a kind of strength — a weapon to protect ourselves."\nI shook my head, still confused... then nodded, hard. I didn\'t understand what she meant, not really. But it was her advice — and that meant I couldn\'t say no.\nThat afternoon, Daphne Theodore taught me the whole alphabet. I copied it down into the little notepad she gave me — my letters crooked and uneven, but all my own. Before she left, I hesitated... then called out after her.\n"Miss Theodore — I remember you said you were an alchemist."\n"I am."\n"What is alchemy?"\n"It\'s a study meant to make people\'s lives better."\nAs she spoke, her eyes lit up. It was as if some flame had kindled behind them, making them shine.\n"So then... the Alchemy Academy is where people study alchemy?"\n"...Yes."\n"If I learn to write well," I asked, "could I go to the Academy too? Could I study alchemy with you, Miss Theodore?"\nI\'d always known my place. And I could read the way people looked at things. Even without asking, I could tell from the nurse\'s reaction that the Academy must be some grand, untouchable place. But just for a heartbeat — with the fire in Daphne\'s eyes — I let myself believe that maybe, just maybe, I had the right to walk towards it too.\nBut it wasn\'t what I imagined.

I told her, tears in my eyes, that Gary was my brother — my only family in the world. I said I hadn\'t heard from him in ages, and that the last I knew, he\'d gone to the Alchemy Academy.\nJust as I\'d hoped, Daphne agreed without hesitation.\nMost of what I told her was true. But in one thing, I lied:\nI didn\'t miss Gary Stone at all. He was my brother, yes — but not all siblings are born to love each other. When I was still no taller than his thigh, Gary would grab me by the neck and squeeze until I couldn\'t breathe — all because I\'d dared to steal a scrap of "his" food.\nI couldn\'t care less where Gary had gone. What I wanted was simply to see Daphne again. I thought she must\'ve grown up in a loving family — because the moment she heard Gary was my brother, she assumed he must be someone dear to me.\n \nDaphne came back, bringing news about Gary Stone.\nBut this time, she looked exhausted. The dark circles under her eyes were plain to see, and it looked like she\'d been crying — faint streaks still marked her cheeks.\nI saw her pacing at the far end of the corridor for ages before she finally walked over. I figured she must\'ve brought bad news. Was she hesitating? Unsure whether to tell me? Or just trying to find the right way to say it?\n"Tiori," she said, kneeling and gripping my shoulders, "I found out what happened to your brother. Please... promise me you\'ll stay strong, no matter what. Will you?"\nAh — so she was going to tell me everything after all. Maybe she wasn\'t any good at lying. Or maybe she just believed that even a child had the right to know the truth.\n"Gary Stone won\'t be coming back," Daphne said, her voice hoarse. "He was caught in an alchemical accident."\nI didn\'t feel a thing. But I still had questions. I didn\'t care about Gary — what I wanted to know was: What kinds of endings waited for people like us — the ones they treated like rubbish?\n"...An accident? Did someone die?"\n"Yes."\n"Did the alchemist kill them?"\n"No."\n"Did Gary kill them?"\n"...No."\n"Then who was the killer?"\n"It was a ghost no one could see," she said. "Or perhaps... it was all of us."\nI shook my head. I didn\'t understand.\n"Then... Miss Theodore," I asked, "will I die like Gary someday too?"\n"If I learn enough words — enough to understand all the books you gave me, enough to master alchemy — will that keep me from ending up like my brother?"\n"I wish I could tell you yes. I used to believe it. I knew people like you — who rose from nothing, and climbed to the top through what they\'d learned." Daphne said softly, brushing her hand over the horn on my head. "But now... I\'ve seen far more fall before they ever reached the peak — shattered to pieces on the way up. There are more of them than the ones who made it."\n"There\'s one thing you must remember, Tiori," she said, enunciating every word. "Stay away from the Academy. Even if you come to love alchemy — never go near that place."\nI nodded, slowly and with all the seriousness I could muster.\nDaphne rose and took out the notepad she always carried. She tore out a blank page.\nI thought she was going to write something — but instead, she folded the paper into a tiny boat.\n"I\'ve heard that among the Charon people, every soul is bound to the water. Tell this boat what you want to say, then set it adrift on the Whisper River. It will carry your thoughts to your brother."\nI held the little boat in both hands and watched her walk away. After that, a long time passed — and I never saw Daphne again.\nOne day, when an Academy staffer came to deliver medicine to Riverside Hospital, I gathered my courage and asked where she\'d gone — why she never came anymore.\nHe told me she\'d gone to the battlefield.

"Not long ago, after another bout of pain, he smashed a glass when no one was watching and slit his wrist."\n"But I had the medicine sent — the one that could cure him!"

She pressed them into my arms — she hadn\'t forgotten that I once told her I wanted to read more. We sat on the bench together for a while. Then she rose, and walked away into the crimson sunset.\n \nWhen I could read every section of the newspaper, Daphne Theodore still hadn\'t come back.\nWhen the design on the candy box she gave me had worn away, Daphne Theodore still hadn\'t come back.\nWhen I\'d grown tall enough that the underpads I carried no longer hid my face, Daphne Theodore still hadn\'t come back.\nWhen I could read even the most complex alchemical texts, Daphne Theodore still hadn\'t come back.\nWhen I learned how to extract potion from Dewiolet blossoms, Daphne Theodore still hadn\'t come back.\nWhen I\'d saved enough to leave Hyperborea and study in Aethyrie, Daphne Theodore still hadn\'t come back.\nWell... the family she came to visit was gone. She had no reason to return.\n \nAt dusk, I stood in the corridor, bidding farewell to the hospital where I had lived and worked for nearly twenty years. The dusk that day was a vivid crimson — just like the last time I saw Daphne.\nThen I saw a figure approaching from the far end of the corridor. She looked like a young, slender girl with blonde hair. My suitcase slipped from my hand. But when I bent to pick it up and looked again... there was no one there.\n"Did you see a girl just now?" I asked Nurse Madeleine. "Tall, thin — blonde hair..."\n"What blonde girl?" she muttered. "And here I thought it was us old ladies who needed glasses."\n"Oh.

        text: 'Dismania\'s Rain beat against the windows of the pallid hospital ward, where a four-year-old girl lay dying.\nThe cloth on her brow had been changed countless times. Medicines dripped through rubber tubes into her veins — yet the fever would not break.\n \nOn the first day, her father clasped her frail, small hand in his own broad palm and pressed it to his tear-soaked stubble. She did not wake.\nOn the second, her mother brought the finest physician in Dismania — a man who had once served the Emperor himself. Yet for all the gold he was paid, he merely shook his head and murmured there was only one chance in ten. She did not wake.\nOn the third, the young nurse tending her lit a candle, folded her hands to her chest, and prayed in a low voice. She did not wake.\nOn the fourth, a funeral director barged in with a sycophant\'s smile, speaking to the parents of splendid hearses and grand processions. The girl\'s enraged father seized a chair and drove him out. She did not wake.\nOn the fifth day, the girl\'s ageing grandmother arrived from her country estate. She looked down at the child, still unconscious, and drew a worn book from her purse. Settling beside the bed, she began to read in a gentle murmur.\n"Long, long ago, mankind dreamed of transmuting base metals into gold as if by magic. They mixed sulphur, salt, and mercury... and many years later, we gained Phoxene."\n"Long, long ago, mankind dreamed of soaring through the skies like birds. They strove to lift balloons with fire... and many years later, we gained the airship."\n"Why are you telling these stories now?" the girl\'s mother protested, eyes red with grief. "She\'s still unconscious — she can\'t hear you! I... I only asked you here to see her one last time, Mother."\n"No, Claudia.\' The old woman smiled faintly. "Daphne always loved to hear these tales. She will wake."\n"Long, long ago, mankind dreamed of driving out sickness like the gods themselves. They ground every herb and root they could find... and many years later, we gained the draughts and tonics we call medicine. These are our alchemy — what is called gezhi in Huaxu, and science in Aethyrie."\nShe kissed the girl\'s pallid cheek. "Believe in the power of great alchemy, Daphne. You will wake. For alchemy is—"\n"...an art that brings... happiness... to humankind."\nIn the ward, eyes first widened in shock, then filled with tears of joy, as the girl\'s pale lips stirred with the secret phrase she shared with her grandmother.\nThe needle of fate spun — and came to rest on its slender tenth. Four-year-old Daphne Theodore awoke.\n \nThough she has long known it was no more than coincidence, Daphne often jokes that it was her grandmother\'s stories of alchemy that granted her a second life. It was also that brush with death that set her resolve: to take up the family calling, to become an alchemist worthy of her mother and the grandparents. Like the generations of alchemists who came before her, she would use this discipline to bring happiness to others — just as the frail, pale child she once was had been drawn back from death, drop by drop, by its medicines.\n \nOnce, she believed this with all her heart.',

        text: "The Royal Alchemy Academy stood atop the highest of Dismania's seven hills. From the tower at its summit, the Whisper River stretched out below like a drawn horizon, dividing the city in two — the old town of white brick on one side, the new town of black iron on the other. And the people looked so small, like ants scurrying with grains of rice. This was the daily view of the Academy's alchemists — and for many, it became their view of the world: that great alchemists were the architects of a prosperous nation, and thus its rightful overseers.\n \nMeanwhile, in the grand hall of the Spathatoi, Sibylle Mason looked down on the assembled alchemists. It was the entrance ceremony of Azoth College — the Academy's subordinate school — and time for the customary speeches from the new intake. Sibylle stifled a yawn. To her, the hall was no different from a ballroom, and these speeches — whether stiff or flamboyant — were just another kind of social currency. She didn't need to listen to know what they'd say. The safest speech was a pledge of loyalty to Hyperborea: a vow to sacrifice all for the Emperor's glory. The fashionable choice was to pose as an eccentric researcher, rhapsodising about their love for the \"mysteries of life\" — usually Filthoids, Charons, and other magical beings. The more outlandish the tone, the more peculiar the manner, the better. The more they resembled lunatics, the louder the applause.\n \nThe final student's florid speech came to an end, and the hall broke into applause. Sibylle caught only part of the next name — some Daphne Theo-something — before a thin girl stepped onto the stage. Among students dressed to make themselves look as bizarre as possible, the girl in a plain white blouse and black skirt was almost invisible.\n She began to speak. Her voice sounded younger than the others'. And suddenly, Sibylle remembered where she'd heard the name before — from Madame Flamel, who was her mentor. She had once pointed to an essay and said to Sibylle: This girl, Daphne Theodore, is bright — as clever as you were once. Only fifteen, but certain to become a fine alchemist one day.\n \nBut what use was brilliance? Hyperborea's Alchemy Academy had never lacked for geniuses. Still bored, Sibylle turned another page of her book. The new student speeches were drawing to a close. The girl was already delivering her final words:\n \n\"So, let me end with my true ideal: Alchemy is the study that brings happiness to humankind. That is why I stand here today.\"\n \nA smattering of applause followed — laced with soft laughter and scattered jeers. Sibylle closed her book. She understood the age they lived in — one growing steadily more vulgar, where people had learned to sneer at ideals and dreams. And here, in a hall where madness and cold-bloodedness were the fashion, Daphne's words were nothing short of a declaration: That she was a relic of the past. Or a naive child, blind to how the world truly worked.\n \nThe freshmen laughed — but their smiles soon froze. From the dais came the sharp sound of applause. It was Sibylle Mason, senior officer of the Legion and honorary dean of the Academy. The Laurelled Charon they scorned for her blood, yet still bowed to in fear. And so, begrudgingly, they followed her lead and clapped along.\n \nOn the stage, Daphne turned her face toward Sibylle. A shaft of light caught her — and for a moment, Sibylle could see only a silhouette, haloed in brightness. What expression lay behind it? A smile? Bewilderment? Gratitude? Or the same calm resolve she had shown in her words?\n \nAt the time, Sibylle paid it no mind. What stirred in her was only a trace of cruel amusement. It had been a long time since the Spathatoi had seen one who still carried such outdated, guileless ideals. And all Sibylle wished to know was this: Once the Academy's gilding was stripped away — when all that remained was bare flesh and bone — how long would the \"ideal\" of this girl, Daphne Theodore, endure?",

        text: 'Daphne handed over her rucksack without a word, submitted to the soldier\'s search, and passed through two heavy doors. It was said the doors were forged with powerful magnets, designed to expose any concealed blade or firearm — a safeguard against assassination for the Legion\'s high command. Yet upon crossing the final threshold, Daphne found herself faintly taken aback: beyond all that elaborate security, Sibylle Mason\'s private residence was stark to the point of austerity. The walls were coarse and grey, stripped of paintings or adornment. A broad dining table and a scattering of hard-backed chairs were all that furnished the space — angular, unembellished, as bare and functional as barrack stock, crafted for nothing but to bear the weight of a body.\n \n"You\'ve come, Daphne." Sibylle\'s voice reached her, muffled through the corridor. "I\'m in the kitchen. Come in."\n \nDaphne responded softly and made her way towards the sound. Her steps were cautious — she had no idea why a senior Legion officer, who had once studied above her at the Alchemy Academy, had summoned her to a private home.\n \nThe kitchen, like the parlour, was framed in bare grey walls. The only trace of colour lay in the vivid red of a pomegranate resting in the violet-haired woman\'s palm. The tip of her knife traced the fruit\'s smooth, taut skin.\n \n"You\'re fifteen minutes early. I wasn\'t yet prepared to receive you." Sibylle\'s blade slipped through the rind, revealing the glistening cluster of translucent seeds. "I dislike hiring servants. Everything here is done by my own hand."\n \n"I\'m sorry to trouble you." Daphne clasped her hands, uneasy. "Perhaps... perhaps you\'d like me to hel—"\n \nRing—ring.\nThe telephone rang, abruptly cutting her short.\n \n"Daphne." Sibylle began dropping the seeds into a white porcelain dish. "Pick it up. Hold the receiver for me." She showed no sign of concern over her guest\'s presence.\n \nDaphne complied, gently raising the earpiece to Sibylle\'s ear. A young man\'s voice came through — clear enough for them both to hear.\n \n"Chief Sibylle, it\'s about the two Forsakens spies. They\'ve been under torture for four days now, but still refuse to name their accomplices. I believe they\'re reaching their limit."\n \n"For many, the body\'s pain means little. You are still green. Do not strike what is hardest in them — strike what is softest."\n \nThe pomegranate seeds landed in the dish with soft, brittle clinks. Sibylle didn\'t lift her gaze. "As I recall, those two are brothers."\n \n"We\'ve already threatened them with each other\'s lives, but neither gave in. It appears they made a pact — resolved to die from the start."\n \n"No. You still haven\'t grasped what I meant by \'the softest part.\'"\n \nShe tipped the pale seeds into a fine copper sieve resting over a glass jug. With a steady, unrelenting grip, she began to press — knuckles whitening as juice seeped crimson through the mesh in a slow, thin stream.\n \n"Do not threaten them with death. Tempt them with hope. Say this: the one who speaks will die — but his brother will live."\n \nA crisp "Yes, ma\'am" crackled down the line, and the call ended. In the sieve, the seeds had turned pale and shrivelled. Sibylle poured the half-jug of juice into two glasses. Daphne\'s hand, still holding the receiver, remained suspended mid-air. A fine film of sweat gathered on her brow. Without a glance back, Sibylle turned and walked ahead. Daphne followed in silence, a few steps behind.\n \n"Daphne. You wish to know the brothers\' fate, do you not?" Sibylle held out a glass of pomegranate juice. "Then stay — and witness their end."\n \nDaphne faltered, then gave a small nod, biting her lower lip. She feigned calm as she swirled the glass, eyes fixed on the red within. Pomegranates had once been dear to her; as a child, she would walk the orchards hand in hand with her parents. But now, in that same familiar crimson, she felt only a creeping dread.\n \nThe minute hand had turned a full circuit and a half when the telephone rang again. It was the same young man\'s voice. "The elder brother has confessed his contact. We\'re already moving to make the arrest. As promised, we released the younger — even returned his sidearm."\n \nDaphne exhaled in quiet relief, only for her smile to falter at the next words. "The younger couldn\'t bear the thought that his brother had traded such precious secrets for his life. Once free, he raised the pistol to his own head and pulled the trigger."\n \n"Ah, such a pity... a will of iron, in one so young." The words were spoken — but not a trace of pity coloured her voice. Her gaze lingered on Daphne, lips curved in a subtle, unreadable smile.\n \n"You knew this would happen. That\'s why you\'re not surprised. You brought me here today so I\'d hear it with my own ears." Daphne\'s lips were dry; her voice wavered despite her effort to steady it. "It was... Dean Silas who asked you to persuade me — to tell me how I should serve the Empire. Wasn\'t it?"\n \n"Silas\'s grievances don\'t concern me," Sibylle said flatly. "Daphne, I brought you here for one reason: to show you what it takes to survive — whether in the Legion or the Academy. Empathy must be kept in measure. Sharp enough to sense weakness... never so unchecked that it renders you useless."\n \n"Excess empathy won\'t just make you useless, Daphne — it will drag you into your own misfortune."\n \nDaphne could scarcely recall how she had managed to feign thanks for Sibylle\'s lesson, nor how she had all but fled that stark house of grey and white. What lingered was the memory of two glasses of pomegranate juice: Sibylle\'s, drained in a single draught, and her own, left untouched. Sometimes, she dreamt of that glass — of the liquid within it: the colour of the pomegranate, the colour of life itself. In her dreams, it spilled over the rim, more and more, until it rose into a crimson river that closed over her... and swallowed her whole.',

        text: 'It was still raining in Dismania.\nThudding knocks and angry shouts echoed through the rain-streaked glass. Someone was calling Daphne\'s name at the top of their lungs.\n \nShe sat curled in a velvet chair by the window. Four days had passed since her release from the Royal Military Prison — and for four days straight, the rain had not let up. A sudden creak from the door made her jolt like a startled kitten, the book slipping from her hands to the floor.\n \n"Forgive me — did I startle you?" The maid stammered. "I only came to bring your supper. You... you haven\'t eaten all day again, Miss Daphne."\n \n"I\'m fine." Daphne\'s gaze remained fixed on the rain-smeared window. Beyond the glass, shadowy figures gathered at the estate gates, umbrellas tilted against the downpour. "More rabble. Is it the same lot as yesterday?"\n \n"They look different — younger, maybe." The maid frowned, trying to recall. "Ah — the one leading them... I think he was one of your classmates from the Alchemic Academy."\n Daphne rose, bracing herself against the armrest. "I\'ll go and see."\n \n"No, Miss Daphne..." The maid seized her hand in fright. "You know they\'ve come for you."\n \nDaphne sighed. "Then what other choice do I have? Shall I let them wake my mother again — and watch her faint a second time?"\n \nShe remembered, two nights ago, standing at this very window as her mother stepped out to face the crowd. She had worn a corset — long out of fashion, but lending her frail frame a touch of dignity. The rain had drowned her words, yet Daphne had seen her curtsey again and again. Always proud, never had she bowed so low. At last, to the maid\'s cry of alarm, her mother collapsed — and only then did the crowd disperse. She had fallen hard on the courtyard stones, her face smeared with mud. Pride and grief had pulled her down, and not even the whalebone corset could keep her upright. Daphne had cradled her where she lay, her own tears vanishing soundlessly into the rain.\n \nNow, the scene beyond the window remained unchanged. And Daphne knew she could not bear to lose another of her kin.\n \nShe pulled her arm free from the maid\'s grasp, went downstairs, and stepped outside without an umbrella. The uproar beyond the gate faltered — the crowd stunned that she had truly come out.\n \n"What is it you want to say?" Daphne unlatched the gate and stepped into the street. The walls of the Theodore estate were smeared with graffiti — "traitor," "demon-spawn," scrawled in harsh, uneven strokes. She forced her eyes away. "Do not wake my mother. We\'ll talk elsewhere."\n \n"You betrayed Hyperborea — just like you betrayed the Alchemy Academy!"\n"Because of you, our brothers and sisters died young!"\n"How can you still wear that calm face? Why haven\'t you knelt and repented?"\n"Always the same pious mask. Now we see your true face!"\n \nHer former classmates drove her back into a corner of the street. She tried to speak, but her voice was lost in the downpour — and in their fury. Someone gave a sharp whistle. Hands seized her shoulders. Overhead, thunder rumbled, low and heavy.\n \nWhy do people cling so stubbornly to the "truth" they choose to believe?\nHer spine slammed against a metal bin with a hollow clang. A fist struck her in the gut. The world spun; she curled in on herself like a shrimp. A boot came down on the hand she had braced against the ground — pain shuddered through her knuckles, as if they might snap beneath the weight.\n \nWhy does it take only a single excuse for people to bare their fangs at their own kind?\nShe thought of the corpses at Lonza Fortress — some comrades, some foes. Some still faintly warm, others already cold. Yes... for a single reason, they had slaughtered one another.\n \nWhy do people shut their eyes to the suffering of others?\nShe thought of the white rabbits she once kept. Pinned to the pristine-white lab bench, they struggled helplessly. Until at last, the syringe in her hand delivered its contents — and the small bodies stilled. She thought of Emilia, her friend from years past. The girl lay sprawled on a snow-white floor, blood blooming from her chest — like a pomegranate burst across a clean white cloth.\n \n"What\'s the point in talking to her? She\'s nothing but demon-spawn — like her traitor father, Avar!"\nThat familiar name wrenched her back to the rain-drenched streets of Dismania.\n"Exactly. Even if you crown them in laurels and keep them on a tight leash, these mongrels still—"\n \nThe ringleader never finished. His smug grin froze. A moment later, he clutched his ear with a cry. The crowd reeled back as lightning split the sky — casting Daphne\'s face in stark, searing relief. She stood with pistol raised, fury blazing in her eyes — a fire no rain could quench.\n \n"Insult my father again, and the next shot won\'t just graze your ear." She forced each word through clenched teeth. "Now get lost."\n \nStudents of the Academy weren\'t allowed to carry firearms in the capital. Though their mouths still spat curses, their feet carried them away at a full run. Daphne leaned against the wall, using the bin at her back to push herself upright. Behind her lay the street leading home, where the maids had likely prepared some fresh dessert to cheer her. But she would not return. Not like this. She couldn\'t bear for the maids to worry — nor let them see her in such disgrace.\n But then... where else could she go?\n \nShe wandered aimlessly through the rain. Night had fully fallen, and she had no idea how long she\'d walked before a bridge loomed ahead — vaguely familiar. She strained to recall. Yes — Sibylle lived near this bridge. They had once spoken in her house... a meeting that ended bitterly.\n \nNow the woman in violet stood on the bridge, a long-handled umbrella in hand. She\'s here to see me at my lowest, Daphne thought. No doubt she\'ll sneer and ask what she asked before — Do you still stay true to your ideals? But she had no answer. The unrelenting rain had rusted her thoughts.\n \nYet Sibylle\'s face held no scorn, no anger. It was as calm as the Whisper River when no wind stirred its surface. She handed Daphne an umbrella, almost casually.\n \n"Go home. Take a hot bath. Change your clothes."',

Rain slid from the mouths of stone gargoyles, leaving dark brown trails along the walls.\nFamiliar figures lined both sides of the street, each standing beneath a long-handled umbrella.\n \n"Alchemy is a science meant to bring happiness to the people," said an elderly woman.\n"Daphne, you will be my pride," said a bright-eyed woman.\n"All I ever wanted was for you to be happy," said a man with a gentle smile.\nShe tried to draw closer, to see if they truly bore the faces she remembered — but their features had blurred, as if the rain had soaked right through their skin.\n\n"Those who suffer in pain — will we ever truly find relief for them?" asked a young researcher.\n"If I learn enough words... if I master alchemy one day — will that keep me from ending up like my brother?" asked a little girl in a hospital orderly\'s uniform.\n"Dismania\'s too far... The rain\'s pouring. The roads are all mud. Will we ever make it back...?" asked a dying soldier.\nDaphne opened her lips to answer — to shape a single "yes." But her throat closed. It was as though her voice had been torn away. No sound came.\n \n"Do you still stay true to your ideals?" The Legion Chief\'s gaze bore down from above.\n The stare seared her eyes. She wanted to flee — but as she turned, a vast chasm yawned before her, bottomless and black.\n"We need to focus on this battle — and on surviving." Her silver-haired, red-eyed comrade laid a steady hand on her shoulder. "Remember what you once said."\nYes... that we might all live on. That was all she\'d wanted then.\n \n"Daphne, do you still remember the dream you had as a child?" A little girl stepped from the corner of the street. Her voice was soft, her brows and eyes uncannily familiar — yes, it was herself, long ago.\n"To bring happiness to people, through alchemy," she replied. "I\'ve never forgotten."\n"But every dream comes at a price," said another voice behind her. It was her own — but cold, in a way she had never heard before. "To gain something, you must give something up. Daphne, ideals are also a luxury for the strong."\n"Then what am I supposed to do?" Daphne asked.\n"Abandon your hollow principles and your useless empathy. Go among them. Become one of them," said the cold voice.\n"No! Befriend beasts — and how can you be sure you won\'t become one yourself?" the child\'s voice cried.\n"Only from a great enough height can you wield the power to change anything," said the cold voice.\n"But once you take that step, there\'s no turning back!" the child\'s voice protested.\n \nTheir voices tangled in endless argument. Daphne\'s head throbbed as though it might split — she felt herself about to be torn in two. She sank to her knees, clutching her head. Slowly, the voices faded, and the last light drained from Dismania\'s sky.\n \nDaphne Theodore awoke in her bedchamber. The rain had stopped; sunlight gleamed on the ivy leaves outside her window.\n "Miss Daphne, someone from the Legion has come to see you." A maid knocked gently at the door. "She... doesn\'t seem to mean any harm."\n \nDaphne rose, put on her coat, and stepped into the courtyard. A young man in a Legion officer\'s uniform stood waiting. Daphne recognised him at once — Sibylle Mason\'s adjutant.\n \n"Miss Theodore," the man said, "Chief Sibylle has asked me to invite you to join a project — if you\'re willing."\n "It\'s called the Second Scion Program."',

        text: 'Lisbell once set all of Elysium astir — for at the tender age of twelve, she drew the long-unclaimed sacred sword, Samael. In that instant, the young noblewoman shone like a diamond newly unearthed, no longer merely a child of lineage, but one deemed worthy to stand among the Seven Virtues — to wield authority and ascend to the very pinnacle of that ancient divine nation.\n \nTo the adults about her, however, there was little astonishment. The mantle of Patience had ever been borne by the ancient and honourable house of Evangelinos. Sooner or later, it was fated to rest upon Lisbell, their sole heir. Yet, still but a child, she understood nothing of it. The morning after she drew the sacred sword, Lisbell sat at the dining table as always, drowsily tapping the rim of her bowl with a spoon. Like any child, she had her fussy dislikes — quinoa, meat pies, sturgeon, pike. Yet for the sake of her health, the old steward unfailingly set those very dishes before her.\n \nUnable to vent her anger at him, she showed her displeasure in the only way she could — a small breach of etiquette, the clink of a spoon against porcelain. The day was already shaping into an irksome one... She forced her way through breakfast, then, as her parents required, turned to the customary post-meal reading. Stretching on tiptoe, she tugged a stack of newspapers from a shelf four times her height — The Morning Bell of the Sacred Tower, a novelty of the northern lands, and at least less soporific than the usual tomes. Rubbing her eyes, Lisbell unfolded the paper. Petite as she was, her feet swung above the floor, and the paper, once unfolded, spanned nearly the breadth of her arms.\n \nShe wrestled with its yellowed, crinkling pages, which rustled faintly, when suddenly she came face to face with her own likeness.\n \n"Huh!!?" A loud, bewildered cry rang out — wholly unfitting for a young lady of her station. It took her a heartbeat to grasp what she saw. Then her voice went echoing through the manor halls: "Mr Steward! Mr Steward! How did I end up in the newspaper!?" Still astonished, she dragged the unwieldy sheet along behind her as she ran, not fully understanding what had happened — but certain that the ever-reliable steward with the long white beard would have the answer.The steward, however, had scarcely slept all night.\n \nAs a son of Elysium and loyal servant of the house of Evangelinos, he knew full well: the girl in the paper, favoured by the gods, must be the long-vacant Patience. Yet he prayed to the Great Nine that time might be turned back — that he might somehow have stayed the hand of fate, held back his headstrong young mistress. If only it could have been a few years later! If the gods, or the family head, willed that she must join the Seven Virtues, why could they not show greater generosity, greater patience? At least until she had lived out the fullness of her childhood... until she came to understand the world\'s ways... until she learned to temper bewilderment with restraint, discontent with discipline... until she outgrew her wayward sympathy and compassion, and learned to accept and endure the fate bestowed upon all by the Great Nine.\n \nLisbell\'s shouts and hurried footsteps rang closer and closer. The old steward knew too well — in a moment, his young mistress would come bursting through the drawing-room door.\n \nHe had only just seen off the Patriarch\'s envoy. In his hands he now held the golden laurel crown bestowed by the Church, together with the summons calling Lisbell to an audience. They weighed almost nothing, yet in his grasp they felt heavy as lead. He could scarcely bring himself to imagine laying such burdens upon those slight, unready shoulders.\n \nAh, her footsteps — still brisk — the privilege of one unburdened by duty. He listened as they drew near, until Lisbell burst into the room, a crumpled newspaper clutched in her hands, her eyes wide with innocent wonder. "Mr Steward — what\'s that you\'re holding?"\n \nAnd in that moment, he knew: the carefree days of his young mistress had come to their end.',
